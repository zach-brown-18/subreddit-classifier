oceans," An extinction cycle happens on Earth that goes like this:

\-the planet begins to warm from greenhouse gases

\-this warms the oceans, and melts the ice

\-this alters the currents in the ocean which mix oxygen into deeper waters

\-the oceans begin to lose oxygen, species begin to die

\-methane/sulfur bacteria from the ocean floor begin to bloom in the low-oxygen water

\-kills off ocean life, emits poison hydrogen sulfide gas into atmosphere

\-life on land is poisoned/suffocated

&amp;#x200B;

Other factors that contribute to this cycle:

\-volcanic eruptions heat the planet and add sulfur to air

\-passing comets add toxic dust into atmosphere/ocean - helping the bacterial blooms

\-the magnetic poles shift, creating a temporarily weaker magnetic field on Earth, letting in harmful UV rays

\-solar flare or micronova

&amp;#x200B;

Seems like we are well into the cycle. So not good news for life that needs oxygen.

ASWAP (Autonomous Sub-aquatic Waste Acquiring and Pre-processing) unit:

It is well known that underwater waste has a **massive destructive** effect on life **above and below** water.

Not only does it directly **harm and kill** living organisms underwater but it also influences the rest of the ecosystem by reducing the ocean plants (which contribute 50-85% of the O2 production on earth) level by approximately **40% since the 80s**.

The ASWAP unit can collect underwater waste and sort them **automatically** using a weakly supervised waste detection model and a waste classification model.

By sending a drone underwater to collect waste, we are removing the need of a trained worker who would ordinarily have to face the **dangers of the depths** to accomplish the same tasks.

One of the greatest issues faced in the ocean cleanup projects today is the **handling of waste** after it is collected. We use **advanced** classification models (92+% accuracy) to sort garbage in our docking stations so that it can be recycled and resold.

Our solution can **safely and efficiently** remove waste debris from underwater areas which may be less accessible to humans, and thus protect the ecosystem.

oceans,"Hi everyone, I work as a protected species observer (PSO) and the company I contract for is looking to recruit more observers for upcoming projects.

Whats a PSO? When a company wants to do a marine geological survey of any kind, be it oil, windmills, or construction, they are required to have PSO onboard to watch out for Marine Mammals, Sea turtles, and other protected species to mitigate any potential damage the survey equipment can cause.

What do I need to be a PSO? Theres a few certifications that are required, as well as your own gear. After you've gotten everything certified you'll probably be $2000 in the hole, however you easily earn this amout back after your first month. The nice thing is if you file your taxes you can write off most of the expenses on your taxes. I can earn a sign up bonus for everyone I recruit so to prevent people from just reading this post and going through the certification themselves, I wont list everything, gotta look out for #1.

Whats a day in the life of a PSO like? Im currently working on a video about this very thing. You pretty much stare at the ocean on a boat, miles from land until you spot a protected species. Then after figuring out if the animal is close enough to be potentially affected by the survey equipment you get to shut down the boats operations. There are incredibly boring days, and there are incredible days where youll see 12 Humpback whales feeding in an upwelling next to the boat, or a group of 70 dolphins follow the boat for hours. We also see tons of other wildlife, sharks, birds, turtles, ect. You have to fill out paper work on the protected species but thats pretty much the hardest thing you have to do. I listen to podcasts, music, and audio books while I am on watch, so you can be some what productive. The Starting pay for PSOs is a day rate and is typically 150-200 a day, but I've been doing this for a year already and have made more than 300$ a day on some projects.

A typical schedule is not something I've had in my exeperience as a PSO. Some PSOs work a constant 5 week on, 5 week off shift. This has not been my experience. Im currently on a project expected to last 2 months, Ive also been projects as short as 11 days. But I also follow the money, whereever the highest pay is, is usually where I am, but some people might prefer a lower day rate in exchange for a more consistent schedule. Thats gonna be more your call.

Whats life like offshore? Mostly what you make of it. I work about 13 hours a day, and out of that time I am on watch for 7-8 hours. the rest of my time, I finish paper work. I also work on scripts for my youtube channel, edit photographs of animals I've seen, work out, eat, watch movies.

What are some disqualifying things for working offshore? The internet is pretty shit offshore, just enough to send emails, and texts, so if you need daily internet this job isnt for you. Honestly though, its wonderful to unplug for a few weeks at a time. Also if you experience motion/sea sickness easily, however most people adapt after a few days. You also need to pass a drug test, which is a huge bummer when you work out of states that are recreationally legal (looking at you Massachusetts). Medical marijuana is still disqualifying, theres no exceptions, they will straight up call a helicopter to pick you up if you fail an on vessel drug test.

Some perks. You get paid to watch wildlife. You get paid pretty well. You can log your sea days for a captains license. International work on all seven continents and all five oceans is a availible (You'll have to be competitive for them however). You can get certifications in Passive acoustic monitoring (Opens up more international work, and higher pay.)

TL;DR: Get paid to watch marine life.

If this sounds like something you want more info on as a career, feel free to comment here, or DM me. Im in port until Tuesday so Ill answer what I can. Ill be offshore on a project for a few weeks and ill answer more when we return to port. You can also check out my instagram for pictures of wildlife i've seen offshore @ Barefoot\_zak.","Looking for marine field experience, in the US, that pays well?

The water wasn‚Äôt pulling us under but it was pulling us away from shore. When we finally got back to our resort that night we were looking up what a rip current was and we ended up learning that an entire family drowned at the exact same beach we were at, at the exact same time we were there. Do you think we were stuck in a rip current? And if we were, how do we get out of it safely because all swimming did was make our arms sore, and screaming for help was useless over the loud crashing waves.",How do you know if you‚Äôre legitimately stuck in a rip tide?

Save Our Seas Saturdays are asking you and your group/org to participate in our first ever Global SOS on June 6th, just before World Oceans Day. Normally we would go to our nearest beach or river every Saturday to pick litter and share a photo online but we have moved to taking action digitally due to the pandemic. We are demanding systemic change from governments and corporations to protect our oceans from threats like climate change, plastic pollution and more. Our first ever Global SOS on June 6th will be part of our week of digital action that we‚Äôre currently planning. You can get involved by following us on social media @SosSaturdays and on June 6th, take a photo of yourself with a sign about the oceans and share it on your social media, similar to Climate Strike Online. Don‚Äôt forget to use #SOSSaturdays too! If you want to help us plan this incredible day of digital action or help coordinate SOS Saturdays in general, please sign up on this website (https://www.saveourseasglobal.org/) to join our workspace. Hope you can join us in fighting for our oceans on June 6th, and there‚Äôs lots more info on our website and social media.

I run a scuba diving/freediving blog, and I've been doing a Q&amp;A with people who are in the diving industry; eg. an UW photographer, a commercial diver, and others. And have a few up-coming interviews with a freediving champion and scuba diving course directors.

I am interested in doing a Q&amp;A with a working marine biologist or coral researcher. Questions would be about your daily work life, coolest/weirdest things you've seen, how to get into the industry, etc.

Please let me know if you would like to be interviewed. I would send you a list of questions to answer, and you'll need to provide 2-3 photos of you or your job.

oceans,"Hello,

I'm making a detailed **list of environmental threats**; but before making it ""official"", I would like to know your opinion about the ***main*** **and** ***sub*** **categories** of those threats. I'm taking marine life example.

For now, here's my classification :

* **Pollution :** Pure Unwanted/**Collateral**  effects of human activities. This include sub-classes of pollution,  maybe chemical (the most common), physical (nets), biological  (algae?),or even energetic (light, sound, radioactivity, heat ?)
* **Poaching :** Targeting **specific** species to gain money by selling it, dead or alive. Poaching can also create collateral effects on other species.
* **Over-fishing :** Targeting edible species, but in a **gluttonous**   way, without any care, making the resources slowly wither away. This   often create collateral effects on other species AND environment, like  the nets **scraping** the coral reef. Or the **electro** fishing...
* **Bad reputation** : Targeting species just to **wipe them** out of the globe, because they have a bad reputation of human/cattle killer The best example is the Great White Shark.
* **Ethic problems :** Ways of treating species without any care for their **suffering**. This include dolphin shows, or seafood eaten alive.
* **Environment conquest :** Targeting the environment to transform it or use it in another way. This include **deforestation** to grow crops, for example. Or even some **mangrove fish farming.**
* **Global warming effects :** All the direct **consequences** of global warming. I don't know if it deserve a category tough, since global warming is caused by CO2/CH4/other **gases pollution**, but there's so **many effects** that it may have it's **own category**.

I don't know where to put **collision** with animals (manatee), and general **stress** due to the sole human presence.  
And maybe add somewhere **genetic** pollution, and **invasive** species. However IDK if it's a **main** category or a **sub** category.

What do you think ? Do you have any proposition for ***main*** classes AND ***sub***\-classes of environmental threats ?",How would you classify the different threats to biodiversity ?

&amp;#x200B;

Here are the conditions for the thing to be relevant for such a project :  


\- I *have* to be able to do **experiments** (for instance, a friend is studying the heat regulation system of whales, and thus is mesuring the thermic diffusion through whale skin and whale fat)  


\- It can't be related to biology (so nothing related to hormones or proteins production, digestive systems, etc.) 

  
\- Morphology-related phonomenons, such as the punch of the shrimp mantis, *are* *welcome*, because they can be interpreted strictly from a physicist's point of view.

Why a whale sanctuary?
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Animals that have been in captivity for most of, if not their entire, lives cannot be expected to be able to sustain themselves independently in the wild. A sanctuary for these animals will give them an environment 300-400 times the size of the biggest known tank, the opportunity to swim freely in straight lines, hunt and forage for their own food, socialize naturally, and interact with the natural world. 
     For a lot of these animals, moving to a sanctuary would be the first opportunity they‚Äôve had to feel the ocean, to see live fish, to experience tides, rub against rocks, and everything else a wild animal should be able to able to experience.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
The Whale Sanctuary Project
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

    There are currently over 50 experts working on the Whale Sanctuary Project, spanning multiple professions and areas of interest. The Whale Sanctuary Project is the first organization solely dedicated to creating seaside sanctuaries in North America for whales, dolphins, and porpoises who are being retired from the entertainment industry, or animals who have been rescued from the wild and need rehabilitation or permanent care. This facility would be the first of it‚Äôs kind, and a huge step in removing the animals currently in captivity from their current situation. Conservation is, of course, very important, but this project is about restoring something we humans so selfishly have taken from these highly intelligent, socially complex creatures by forcing them to live in captivity for our entertainment. If there are no sanctuaries built, these animals are destined to continue performing until they die. 
     Instead of the concrete walls of a tank, the animals released into the sanctuary will live in a dynamic and complex world ready for them to interact with. The sanctuary will be in a netted-off area such as a bay or a cove. All of the proposed sites have over 100 acres (484,000 sq. yards) with an average depth of 50 feet (15 meters) throughout. that‚Äôs over 400 times the size of the largest display tank at a high-end marine park. 
     There will be rigorous environmental impact studies to be sure the sanctuary will have no negative effects on the wildlife already calling the area home.  The first phases of development would include the enclosure barriers, infrastructure, lab, medical and sanitation services, food prep services, security, and animal care facilities. Future phases would provide opportunities for internships, visitors centers, and the type of equipment needed to enhance our educational outreach, such as underwater cameras and hydrophones.
     Depending on the location chosen and the kind of infrastructure needed to be built, a rough estimate for the cost of a sanctuary would be around $20 million. The long-term care of the facility and the animals would be payed through endowments, sustaining donations, and other revenue-generating opportunities, such as educational materials and programs. The project was launched with a $200,000 donation from Munchkin, Inc., the global baby product company. The company has pledged a total of at least $1 million towards the completion of the sanctuary.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
How can we help?
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Keep the conversation going - on social media, with friends and family, at school and in the workplace. Social media is quickly becoming the stage in which effective change happens. Encourage everyone you know NOT to buy a ticket to MarineLand, SeaWorld, or any other marine park that exhibits these animals. On the website,  https://whalesanctuaryproject.org, you can donate directly to the cause, and also sign up for a newsletter that will keep you updated on the progress being made. The team is always looking to add people whose skills can contribute to the cause.","Not sure if this is allowed here, but I created a subreddit for discussion and support of the Whale Sanctuary Project - We are r/whalesanctuary, check us out!"

Unlike a lot of other areas where there is a city nearby, this area was facing the gulf of Thailand and was hundreds of miles away from a major city.   Yet, plastic was floating in from everywhere.

This is the problem I  am seeing more and more as I travel, spend time looking at cities, and  working with this issue. We need a fresh look at how we are going to  actually address the issues, be it through the design of products, consumer awareness, waste management, and ocean cleanup.

There simply is no magic bullet, ocean vacuum, or bio-plastic that will do it all.

oceans,"Several models have been used for resource assessment of Thunnus alalunga, but the assessment results of these models are uncertain. Therefore, this paper analyzes the factors affecting resource assessment of Thunnus alalonga. The analysis results show the following results: (1) The quality of catch volume, body length composition or age composition data of the Indian Ocean albacore tuna fishery is affected by unreported, unreported or misreported fishery data, too low sample number and changes in sampling protocol, etc. (2) Although the catch per unit effort (CPUE) was standardized, the quality of standardized CPUE data was still seriously affected by the change of target species and spatial distribution of catch effort. (3) Studies on population ecology and reproductive biology of albacore tuna in the Indian Ocean are still relatively weak, and information on population structure, reproduction, growth and natural death is relatively lacking. In resource assessment, relevant parameter Settings need to be borrowed from the research results of other ocean regions. (4) The Marine environment has a significant impact on the resource change and spatial distribution of albacore tuna in the Indian Ocean, but the assessment model seldom considers the impact of Marine environment. Due to the above problems, the current assessment results are uncertain. In the future, we should continue to explore ways to improve the quality of resource assessment and establish a management strategy evaluation framework to avoid the impact of the uncertainty of fishery resource assessment results on the sustainable development of the fishery.

oceans,"I have a passion for natural science (especially physics), engineering, and exploration. My initial thought was to study aerospace engineering and work for NASA or ESA etc. That way my passion for natural science, engineering, and exploration would be covered. But that is a very far-fetched dream. And if I didn't get to work for these big organisations, I could work for companies that produce satellites or passenger planes with a degree in aerospace engineering, but that would only cover natural science and engineering.

Then I thought about the oceans. It has been said a lot of times that we know more about the space than our own oceans. What if I focused on exploring the oceans instead of space?

&amp;#x200B;

My questions are:

1) With a passion for natural science (*not necessarily* physics), engineering, and exploration, what job(s) will let me explore the oceans?

1a) How likely am I to get the job(s) in question 1) (entry difficulty)?

1b) What education do I need to get the job(s) in question 1)?

2) What if I scratch my passion for natural science and/or engineering, what job(s) will let me explore the oceans?

Hi guys!

First time posting on here, so I'm not sure if this is allowed or not. Anyway here goes.

My name is Sebastian, I'm 20 and I'm the founder of Surf'n'Clean. Surf'n'Clean is a non-profit aimed at reducing ocean plastic pollution through a range of eco-friendly products aimed at surfers and beachgoers.

Our main product right now is the SurfPocket, which is a mesh-like pocket that goes on the front of a surfboard. This allows surfers to pick up rubbish whilst they are surfing.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/3zpni33nfvo21.jpg

Currently we are still in the development phase, and have launched a crowdfunding page to try and get us to the production and manufacturing stage. You can find more information on our website ( [www.surfnclean.com](https://www.surfnclean.com/)) or on our social medias (@surfnclean)

It would mean a lot if you could have a look and give feedback!

(won't post link to crowdfunding until admins give me the go ahead)

Volunteer Opportunity:

Swimmer and ocean advocate Ben Lecomte is looking for new crew members to volunteer on a 3-month swimming/sailing expedition from Hawaii to California. 

After spending 165 days at sea and swimming over 1500 nautical miles off the coast of Japan in 2018, Ben and crew were amazed by the ocean and all the random encounters with wildlife, more surprising than the wildlife however was the daily encounters with plastic and marine trash. Driven by this confronting experience, Ben and crew now plan to head into the highest concentration of ocean plastic in the world, commonly known as the ‚ÄòGreat Pacific Garbage Patch‚Äô. 

They are seeking marine engineers, scientists, sailors, medics, videographers, photographers, influencers and plastic warriors available from May to September 2019.

oceans,"Hello ! 

I have to pass exams in about a year and a part of these is a personal project. The point is to find a subject linked one way or another to the Ocean, as well as to Physics and/or Chemistry (level : 2nd year of University). I have one or two ideas but it is really stressing me out as I am not super confident about them. The thing is, I don't know much about interesting, surprising things about the ocean worth to research on. I would like to avoid pollution-problems and acidity-levels as they are really common themes. If you could help, that would be awesome. (I keep on checking r/oceans as well for ideas but it seems to -understandably- stick to animals and pollution)

I hope you can help me here. Have a nice day !

oceans,"I am currently attending a university outside of my home country (USA) and working with a wonderful professor for my MSc (oceanography). I definitely want to continue on to get a PhD, but I'm not sure if I should stay here.

On the one hand, my advisor is great and I really like the research I do here. I find it to be very timely and impactful in the context of climate change. There is definitely more I can learn from my advisor and this is one of the few groups conducting this research; I have the opportunity to become a world-class expert if I stay.

On the other hand, I feel like there are better funding opportunities available to me back in the US and I like the idea of building a broader set of skills by changing research topics as well. I've also heard that it would be a good idea to change programs so I don't end up becoming a carbon copy of my current advisor, which may hurt my career prospects later.

oceans,"Plastic is a common material that is being produced on a massive scale and is used in nearly everything. With an increase in plastic production there is also an increase in the amount of plastic that is being discarded. When exposed to UV light and abrasion large pieces of plastic will become brittle and break into smaller pieces. After a certain point the pieces will be less than five millimeters in length and become known as secondary microplastics. Some plastics are intentionally produced as fine particles for a variety of uses and are known as primary microplastics. These microplastics will eventually end up in the ocean where they can cause a number of problems. Microplastics can be eaten by plankton or small fish which mistake it for food or by deposit feeders which consume them from the sediments they ingest. Once in an animals system microplastics do not breakdown and most are not eliminated from the animal as waste but remain in its system. This can lead to the animal filling it stomach and starving, poisoning the organism and affecting the animal‚Äôs reproductive capabilities among other health risks. When these plankton and small fish are eaten they still have plastic in them which is then transferred to the organism which ate them and continue to the top apex predator through the process of biomagnification. Therefor microplastics do not just affect the small organisms that eat the plastic particles but instead have effects on every organism

A major group of microplastics are fibers from synthetic clothing that come off while in the wash. It has been found that front loading washing machines generally produce fewer fibers than do top loading washing machines and is advertised by some companies such as Patagonia as ways to help reduce the creation of microplastics. Knowing this using front loading washing machines when given the option and reducing the amount clothing is washed will help reduce the inputs of microplastics to the ocean.",Microplastics in the ocean

Not only that, but they‚Äôre running a ridiculous referral program right now where they literally give you a free $50 just by signing up through a referral link. I signed up through my buddy‚Äôs link ago with $50 from my bank account, and it got automatically bumped up to $100!

Watch the video to see what they‚Äôre about, then follow my referral link below to sign up!! Feel free to put any questions in the comments, I‚Äôm no expert but as a long-time environmentalist and a fairly new investor, I‚Äôm loving what Swell stands for.

Did you know that halfway between California¬†and Hawaii is a FLOATING PATCH OF PLASTIC GARBAGE that, by the latest estimates, has grown to 1 1‚ÅÑ2 times the size of the continental United States?¬†It is estimated to be 90 feet¬†deep. 

Unbelievable right? And it is actually   
one of five¬†giant floating Garbage Patches in the world‚Äôs oceans! It turns out that when opposing currents collide, they form swirling vortexes called GYRES, where trash in the ocean is deposited. 

So how does the plastic trash enter the ocean?  Scientists believe that over 80% of the trash comes from people leaving it on the beach or from trash thrown into storm drains.¬† 

What should we do? Stop throwing trash in the oceans!

oceans,"Ocean waters are rising because of global warming. One reason is of course, the ice is melting from the glaciers, the Antarctica, Greenland and other places where it snows. Another reason is that when the water gets warm, it becomes less dense and when it's less dense, it expands thus causing the water to rise. 

https://i.redd.it/jyex6hcxbwa11.jpg

It's high time that we all get concerned about our oceans and the global warming itself.¬†Rising oceans are a big deal. It will force the millions living around it to move farther away from it to avoid its effect like floods which can be massive enough to wash away their homes. It can make storm surges worst like that of Super Sandy which hit the US East Coast in 2012. These among other effects of rising oceans can cost trillions of dollars. Bottom line is, if we take care of our environment, global warming may reduce and when it does, perhaps we can avoid rising oceans. ",Ocean Rising is Big Deal!

Since I am a dedicated crocheter and crafter, I was thinking to purchase yarn \(which I described above\), in order to crochet, knit \(whatever ideas I'll have\), animals that were saved by buying this particular yarn, to sell them non\-profit. 

Unfortunately I am not able to find any organisation I can buy such yarn from, although many different big brands already use it. Does anyone have an idea, where I can get it from?

Hey fellow ocean\-lovers!

I've spent my entire life living near the ocean, from colder California waters to tropical waters in the Hawaiian islands. We are reaching a real crisis in the way we care for our seas, and luckily A LOT of us give a damn about it. There are a lot of groups, marine\-scientists and individuals doing everything they can to protect our oceans, but we have to keep pushing. 

In light of this, I just joined a colleague on a new project. We have just launched a **political action committee** called [Blue Uprising](https://www.blueuprising.org/). We fight for those who fight for the ocean, and we're doing everything we can to support science\-minded representation in coastal congressional districts. We care about: offshore drilling, marine protected areas, sustainable fishing and crabbing, climate change &amp; ending single use plastic.

While financial support is a huge part of how we run campaigns to ensure that science\-minded officials are elected, we need support on social, and word of mouth. I would appreciate it so much if this awesome Reddit community would give us a little love, and follow some of our social channels as we share information on ocean, surfing and conservation related topics. 

**Any support would be amazing as we get this project off the ground. Please follow us on** [**Twitter**](https://twitter.com/blueuprisingpac)**,** [**Instagram**](https://www.instagram.com/blueuprisingpac/)**,** [**Facebook**](https://business.facebook.com/BlueUprising/)**, check out our website,** [**BlueUprising.org**](https://blueuprising.org/)

Also, if you want to contribute any content \(for a byline\), have interest in joining the fight, have concerns about coastal legislation in your community, or are working on your own ocean\-conservation projects that you need some support with, please leave a comment or shoot us an email!

Thank you!",Blue Uprising needs your help!

Next week I am putting on an event that is themed after the idea of being on the sea floor. It's a party atmosphere but those of us in charge really want to incorporate activism related to the themes of the events we put on. To that end this time around we are pushing the agenda of ocean conservation and how terribly humans are polluting them. 

We're planning to have a booth with reusable bottles and bags that can be taken but I could really use some simple, to the point literature on how bad plastic pollution is for the oceans and some simple ways to make a difference in your every day life. [This is the closest thing I've found](http://static1.squarespace.com/static/55b29de4e4b088f33db802c6/t/5608394ae4b044c9708595c4/1443379530408/PPC_OneSheet-English.pdf) but doesn't really have any actionable advice. Most of the other stuff I have found are long reports which nobody is going to read at a party.

oceans,"Ocean experts of reddit, your help in solving a conundrum would be appreciated: **I need to work out if a hypothetical river is navigable**.

*Long story short*: I‚Äôm writing a book where sea levels rise 230m. Yes, I know that kind of rise isn't actually possible, its very much a fiction book. I need to work out if my protagonists can sail a small boat along a narrow strait that has opened up. It runs between Brecon and Llandovery, pretty much where the A40 used to run - you can see on the map here: http://www.floodmap.net/?ll=51.969032,-3.654099&amp;z=12&amp;e=230

At its shallowest it is 5m, but the majority of its length it‚Äôs much deeper and wider. My question is, what would tides be like in a tiny narrow strait like this? I assume they would be quite severe, since it connects the North Sea with the Atlantic? I assume also that if they are quite severe, they would have eroded the channel quite quickly, making it deeper and wider in the course of a few years?

Obviously this is mostly guess work, but assuming there was no vast change to how tides work in my post apocalyptic world with trillions of gallons of extra water: what would you imagine this stretch would act like?
