oceans," An extinction cycle happens on Earth that goes like this:

\-the planet begins to warm from greenhouse gases

\-this warms the oceans, and melts the ice

\-this alters the currents in the ocean which mix oxygen into deeper waters

\-the oceans begin to lose oxygen, species begin to die

\-methane/sulfur bacteria from the ocean floor begin to bloom in the low-oxygen water

\-kills off ocean life, emits poison hydrogen sulfide gas into atmosphere

\-life on land is poisoned/suffocated

&amp;#x200B;

Other factors that contribute to this cycle:

\-volcanic eruptions heat the planet and add sulfur to air

\-passing comets add toxic dust into atmosphere/ocean - helping the bacterial blooms

\-the magnetic poles shift, creating a temporarily weaker magnetic field on Earth, letting in harmful UV rays

\-solar flare or micronova

&amp;#x200B;

Seems like we are well into the cycle. So not good news for life that needs oxygen.

ASWAP (Autonomous Sub-aquatic Waste Acquiring and Pre-processing) unit:

It is well known that underwater waste has a **massive destructive** effect on life **above and below** water.

Not only does it directly **harm and kill** living organisms underwater but it also influences the rest of the ecosystem by reducing the ocean plants (which contribute 50-85% of the O2 production on earth) level by approximately **40% since the 80s**.

The ASWAP unit can collect underwater waste and sort them **automatically** using a weakly supervised waste detection model and a waste classification model.

By sending a drone underwater to collect waste, we are removing the need of a trained worker who would ordinarily have to face the **dangers of the depths** to accomplish the same tasks.

One of the greatest issues faced in the ocean cleanup projects today is the **handling of waste** after it is collected. We use **advanced** classification models (92+% accuracy) to sort garbage in our docking stations so that it can be recycled and resold.

Our solution can **safely and efficiently** remove waste debris from underwater areas which may be less accessible to humans, and thus protect the ecosystem.

oceans,"Hi everyone, I work as a protected species observer (PSO) and the company I contract for is looking to recruit more observers for upcoming projects.

Whats a PSO? When a company wants to do a marine geological survey of any kind, be it oil, windmills, or construction, they are required to have PSO onboard to watch out for Marine Mammals, Sea turtles, and other protected species to mitigate any potential damage the survey equipment can cause.

What do I need to be a PSO? Theres a few certifications that are required, as well as your own gear. After you've gotten everything certified you'll probably be $2000 in the hole, however you easily earn this amout back after your first month. The nice thing is if you file your taxes you can write off most of the expenses on your taxes. I can earn a sign up bonus for everyone I recruit so to prevent people from just reading this post and going through the certification themselves, I wont list everything, gotta look out for #1.

Whats a day in the life of a PSO like? Im currently working on a video about this very thing. You pretty much stare at the ocean on a boat, miles from land until you spot a protected species. Then after figuring out if the animal is close enough to be potentially affected by the survey equipment you get to shut down the boats operations. There are incredibly boring days, and there are incredible days where youll see 12 Humpback whales feeding in an upwelling next to the boat, or a group of 70 dolphins follow the boat for hours. We also see tons of other wildlife, sharks, birds, turtles, ect. You have to fill out paper work on the protected species but thats pretty much the hardest thing you have to do. I listen to podcasts, music, and audio books while I am on watch, so you can be some what productive. The Starting pay for PSOs is a day rate and is typically 150-200 a day, but I've been doing this for a year already and have made more than 300$ a day on some projects.

A typical schedule is not something I've had in my exeperience as a PSO. Some PSOs work a constant 5 week on, 5 week off shift. This has not been my experience. Im currently on a project expected to last 2 months, Ive also been projects as short as 11 days. But I also follow the money, whereever the highest pay is, is usually where I am, but some people might prefer a lower day rate in exchange for a more consistent schedule. Thats gonna be more your call.

Whats life like offshore? Mostly what you make of it. I work about 13 hours a day, and out of that time I am on watch for 7-8 hours. the rest of my time, I finish paper work. I also work on scripts for my youtube channel, edit photographs of animals I've seen, work out, eat, watch movies.

What are some disqualifying things for working offshore? The internet is pretty shit offshore, just enough to send emails, and texts, so if you need daily internet this job isnt for you. Honestly though, its wonderful to unplug for a few weeks at a time. Also if you experience motion/sea sickness easily, however most people adapt after a few days. You also need to pass a drug test, which is a huge bummer when you work out of states that are recreationally legal (looking at you Massachusetts). Medical marijuana is still disqualifying, theres no exceptions, they will straight up call a helicopter to pick you up if you fail an on vessel drug test.

Some perks. You get paid to watch wildlife. You get paid pretty well. You can log your sea days for a captains license. International work on all seven continents and all five oceans is a availible (You'll have to be competitive for them however). You can get certifications in Passive acoustic monitoring (Opens up more international work, and higher pay.)

TL;DR: Get paid to watch marine life.

If this sounds like something you want more info on as a career, feel free to comment here, or DM me. Im in port until Tuesday so Ill answer what I can. Ill be offshore on a project for a few weeks and ill answer more when we return to port. You can also check out my instagram for pictures of wildlife i've seen offshore @ Barefoot\_zak.","Looking for marine field experience, in the US, that pays well?

The water wasn‚Äôt pulling us under but it was pulling us away from shore. When we finally got back to our resort that night we were looking up what a rip current was and we ended up learning that an entire family drowned at the exact same beach we were at, at the exact same time we were there. Do you think we were stuck in a rip current? And if we were, how do we get out of it safely because all swimming did was make our arms sore, and screaming for help was useless over the loud crashing waves.",How do you know if you‚Äôre legitimately stuck in a rip tide?

oceans,"Hi all, hope you‚Äôre doing okay during these difficult times. Save Our Seas Saturdays are asking you and your group/org to participate in our first ever Global SOS on June 6th, just before World Oceans Day. Normally we would go to our nearest beach or river every Saturday to pick litter and share a photo online but we have moved to taking action digitally due to the pandemic. We are demanding systemic change from governments and corporations to protect our oceans from threats like climate change, plastic pollution and more. Our first ever Global SOS on June 6th will be part of our week of digital action that we‚Äôre currently planning. You can get involved by following us on social media @SosSaturdays and on June 6th, take a photo of yourself with a sign about the oceans and share it on your social media, similar to Climate Strike Online. Don‚Äôt forget to use #SOSSaturdays too! If you want to help us plan this incredible day of digital action or help coordinate SOS Saturdays in general, please sign up on this website (https://www.saveourseasglobal.org/) to join our workspace. Hope you can join us in fighting for our oceans on June 6th, and there‚Äôs lots more info on our website and social media.

How can i find the border to an ocean such as the Atlantic Ocean? Where does the Pacific edge end?  It started with a caption of my friends saying they are swimming in the Atlantic while living in PEI. I believe that its actually the Gulf of St.Lawrence which made me wonder if , me living on the west coast ,have I ever swam in the actual Pacific? Or was it a strait or gulf or whatever else.

I run a scuba diving/freediving blog, and I've been doing a Q&amp;A with people who are in the diving industry; eg. an UW photographer, a commercial diver, and others. And have a few up-coming interviews with a freediving champion and scuba diving course directors.

I am interested in doing a Q&amp;A with a working marine biologist or coral researcher. Questions would be about your daily work life, coolest/weirdest things you've seen, how to get into the industry, etc.

Please let me know if you would like to be interviewed. I would send you a list of questions to answer, and you'll need to provide 2-3 photos of you or your job.

oceans,"Hello,

I'm making a detailed **list of environmental threats**; but before making it ""official"", I would like to know your opinion about the ***main*** **and** ***sub*** **categories** of those threats. I'm taking marine life example.

For now, here's my classification :

* **Pollution :** Pure Unwanted/**Collateral**  effects of human activities. This include sub-classes of pollution,  maybe chemical (the most common), physical (nets), biological  (algae?),or even energetic (light, sound, radioactivity, heat ?)
* **Poaching :** Targeting **specific** species to gain money by selling it, dead or alive. Poaching can also create collateral effects on other species.
* **Over-fishing :** Targeting edible species, but in a **gluttonous**   way, without any care, making the resources slowly wither away. This   often create collateral effects on other species AND environment, like  the nets **scraping** the coral reef. Or the **electro** fishing...
* **Bad reputation** : Targeting species just to **wipe them** out of the globe, because they have a bad reputation of human/cattle killer The best example is the Great White Shark.
* **Ethic problems :** Ways of treating species without any care for their **suffering**. This include dolphin shows, or seafood eaten alive.
* **Environment conquest :** Targeting the environment to transform it or use it in another way. This include **deforestation** to grow crops, for example. Or even some **mangrove fish farming.**
* **Global warming effects :** All the direct **consequences** of global warming. I don't know if it deserve a category tough, since global warming is caused by CO2/CH4/other **gases pollution**, but there's so **many effects** that it may have it's **own category**.

I don't know where to put **collision** with animals (manatee), and general **stress** due to the sole human presence.  
And maybe add somewhere **genetic** pollution, and **invasive** species. However IDK if it's a **main** category or a **sub** category.

What do you think ? Do you have any proposition for ***main*** classes AND ***sub***\-classes of environmental threats ?",How would you classify the different threats to biodiversity ?

Here are the conditions for the thing to be relevant for such a project :  


\- I *have* to be able to do **experiments** (for instance, a friend is studying the heat regulation system of whales, and thus is mesuring the thermic diffusion through whale skin and whale fat)  


\- It can't be related to biology (so nothing related to hormones or proteins production, digestive systems, etc.) 

  
\- Morphology-related phonomenons, such as the punch of the shrimp mantis, *are* *welcome*, because they can be interpreted strictly from a physicist's point of view.
