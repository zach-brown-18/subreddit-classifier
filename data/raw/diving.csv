diving,"Primary light is the one you generally use, and if the primary light fails during a dive, you switch to a backup light. What are the differences between them? 

The primary dive lights should be:

* They are robust and powerful.
* They have long burn times.
* They are higher in power, and brighter for deeper uses.

The secondary dive lights usually are:

* They are more compact, smaller and lighter in weight.
* They have shorter burn times.
* They are typically less powerful, but sufficient enough to serve as a backup.

Carrying a backup light on your dive is a good idea. You never know when your primary dive light will die out, or if you are going on longer dives, it‚Äôs always worthwhile to have a secondary dive light with you for those deeper, darker depths you plan going through. For example, you can take [D26 1600](https://www.xtar.cc/product/XTAR-D26-1600-Diving-Flashlight-43.html) as your primary dive light and [D20 1000](https://www.xtar.cc/product/XTAR-D20-1000-Diving-Flashlight-143.html) as your secondary light.

diving,"Many u/w photographers like the Macro shooting for the creatures. Usually the strobes are the primary lighting tools for you. But do you know your backup dive light can also do it? With proper position and composition, you can shot unique images without the extra cost of a strobe. 

Why? As you know, the Macro shooting is shot the macro subjects up close. Only a single point of light is needed to illuminate the macro creatures and make them show their original colors. That's enough. In that case, a dive torch with narrow beams can do it.

Using this dive torch to create a spotlight, you can actually see the beam range before shooting a picture. ¬†

Bright your dive light around the side of the subject, rather than head-on. It can create the slide lighting. It could accentuate textures and make the image a bit moodier. Handy dive light works well especially for subjects in the sand such as stargazer and seahorses, which aren‚Äôt too skittish to move if you place a dive torch close by. 

Dive torches can also be used to backlight for sedentary subjects. If the subject doesn‚Äôt move at all, then you can simply rest the torch in the sand or an empty spot. However, if the subject is swimming or in the water column, then you‚Äôll need another diver to hold the light. 

What‚Äôs your experience? More tips and suggestions are always welcomed.",Using a dive light for Macro lighting in u/w photography?

diving,"Hello fellow Redditors,

I am newbie so pardon my ignorance - I am getting my certificate later this month. I live in South Florida and my best friend, who is an avid diver, is getting married late Spring 2021. He's been trying to get me into diving for years but between work, travel, baby, money... it took a push. The push came in the form of a diving trip bachelor party for 7 days and an expected 25+ dives. I am jumping in head first - I want to buy some equipment and get taught in that equipment. The bachelor party diving will be happening(covid willing) in St. Lucia or the like in Feb/March 2021.

Here's where I need help. I have done extensive research and have narrowed down two different setups for BCD but I am stuck between the two. If you've made it this far and you area an experienced diver - maybe you can help - and thank you in advance if you can.

I like the simple approach of wing, backplate and harness. I have no interest in a jacket style BCD. I will almost exclusively be diving the Caribbean or south Florida for the foreseeable future. I am 5'11"" and 190lbs and a strong swimmer (don't know if any of that is relevant)

**Q: Do I get the Apeks One piece harness WITH the SS Apeks backplate +Apeks WTX D30 wing or WITH aluminum Apeks backplate + Apeks WTX D18 wing?**

I plan on using a standard weight belt that I use for lobstering/pole fishing for lead. I have 16lbs in 2lbs increments and a standard rubber belt. I don't know how many pounds I will need yet to be zero buoyant. I will be using neoprene tech shorts for storage. Again - don't know if any of this helps.

I will be traveling with it but the weight difference of 5lbs doesn't seem to make a difference between alum and SS in the backplate. I would simply use the SS as more weight requiring less for my belt. I chose those combinations thinking that would be the most efficient combo --- I could be wrong and correct me if I am not. If I missed the mark entirely - please provide constructive criticism and tell me what I should get. :- )

Side note: I am leaning towards the aluminum backplate and 18lb wing as my wife (5'5"" and 130 lbs) could potentially use it if it's not enough lift for me so potentially no harm - no foul.

However, it's also double in price.

My question is, do you think it's worth investing in the Suunto D5 model? If you have experience with it, what are your thoughts and would you recommend it? Is it worth double the price of the Cressi Giotto?

I recently interviewed Kathlyn, a scuba diving citizen scientist who focuses on marine litter and ocean conservation. I'll be honest, I didn't know much about citizen science before and what their work can do to help the wider scientific and general community.

diving,"Just as a foreword, I am looking for anecdotal stories, not medical advice. Hoping someone may have gone through something similar and can show me the light. I should also note I'm not particularly new to diving; I have roughly 80 dives under my belt without issues.

Back in December, I was on a dive with a lot of surge bringing me up and down and my ear started to not feel right. According to DAN resources, all signs pointed to a middle ear barotrauma. As I was not in my home state (yay US health care!), I couldn‚Äôt afford to see an out of network MD until I got home. Between work, COVID, required referrals in the US, and appts being booked months away, it took A WHILE to finally get seen by an ENT (today‚Ä¶). 

Back in December, on my flight home, I had SEVERE pain in my ear. Thankfully the flight was quick. Since then, the pain has only been a dull ache for the most part but certain things set it off to being more painful like cold/wind/water/loud noises/physically pushing on my ear. Trying to swim in a cold lake recently and my ear was very uncomfortable. I‚Äôve been taking Flonase daily for the last couple months to no avail 

Flash-forward to today. I get a hearing test and the results are normal. I get an ENT to look into my ears and nose and throat and that‚Äôs all normal. He can‚Äôt figure it out. Says I have no fluid, no infection...

I just want to be able to dive again but if it hurts to swim at the surface, I‚Äôm sure down with pressure will be extra painful! Free diving a few feet below the surface HURTS.

Has anyone out there experienced something similar? Did you find out what was wrong/find something that would help? I'd like to get a second opinion of another ENT but want to come in with some suggestions!",Ear issues anyone? From someone who really wants to dive again

diving,"Hello people.

I recently started the search for a backplate/wing setup. I noticed some companies tend to offer 2 types of straps. The basic type that need to be set up once and kept the same for all dives and the ""deluxe"" versions. Versions that have clips like a regular bcd to offer easyer adjustment and are more targeted towards rec divers.
(example: xdeep zen VS xdeep zen deluxe) 

What are your opinions about those ""deluxe"" versions?
I'm a rec diver and often change between a 7mm wetsuit and a 7mm with an extra 7mm on top. Thus I was thinking of getting an adjustable one. However I read on some forums that it's not at all needed even for a change in wetsuit.
Any divers here with some experience on this topic?

Looking for a little wisdom please.

So, I'm currently based in the UK and dive a handful of times a year when travelling for fun and work (outdoor instructor and expedition leader) 

Thing is, as cash is always tight I either borrow or rely on my dive buddies for computer related info.

However, I'm about to move to Dakar and plan on working through my certs over the next year or so (Currently only OW) but would like to equip myself with a computer from a UK based company (cost, warranty, repair etc will be easier this way when I visit the home) that will work for me at my current level but also be suitable on my journey through the certs. (End goal is definitely dive instruction for more international employment oppos)

Have used Suunto Zoops so far and like them, if that helps. 

So yeah, advice please?

i have a (stupid?) question on diving or underwater swimming in the local swimming pool at a maximal depth of 2, maybe 3 meters.

Short things first I have ear problems on both my ears, but especially on my right one, where the ear drum is deformed and has scars on it, which gives a feeling of permanent ear pressure or.. inflammation or something like that.
Since I really love swimming and diving in low water Situations but kinda cannot because of this reason.

Now my question is: 

Can I go diving / swimming under water with ear plugs, that don't have a membrane for water pressure in it? Or is it too dangerous to do it like that. 
My ear plugs would be made at my hearing aid provider with a perfect fit ear plug for around 80‚Ç¨ made of some sort od silicon or rubber like material.

If not, are there any serious alternatives to that? Ive read about plugs with holes / specific membranes in it that helped a lot of people, but wasn't sure if it helped in my case.. 

Im sorry for the dumb question, since I think this sub isn't particularly the right for my purposes. 
It would be maximum 3 meters of depth. And even if I wanted to do snorling im reefs it would be around the same depth. 
And sorry for my bad english, it isn't my Mother language.

diving,"The super short summary: Need help buying gear for snorkeling. Moving to San Diego for grad school for 2 years, already know I want to spend free time snorkeling/learning to freedive. I have $250 to spend on snorkel, fins, and mask. Would rather spend money once than upgrade in in 12 months using student loan money, so I'd love for it to be stuff I can grow in to.

Conventional wisdom when buying gear: GO TO A LOCAL SHOP. This is a dope idea, and I'd love to support local shops in San Diego, but something tells me mask-try ons aren't really a great idea at the moment. Can y'all help me out???

Mask-- female, medium size face I guess? Accepting any and all recommendations.

Snorkel-- I've gotten the sense from reading that dry is a bad idea for freediving; what about semi-dry? 

Fins-- Kind of at a loss-- halp!

I love to free dive and lobster dive during the season and have been doing so for around 4-5 years now. I used to be able to hit 50ft(15m) every dive pretty easy up until about two years ago, for some reason I began having trouble equalizing and now can max out at 50ft(15m) on my first 1-3 dives and then usually end up diving no deeper than 10-20ft(3-6m) depending on the day. 

My left ear feels totally fine, however my right ear is having problems, when I put my finger just under where my ear starts(just below the earlobe) and where the top of my jaw flexes it feels like theres a tiny pea sized air bubble there and isn't there on the left side.

I'm wondering if anyone has heard or experienced this themselves as I think it might be the cause to my problems if it is affecting my Eustachian tube. Its been there for about 2 years now(at least thats when I noticed it) and I'm wondering what it is.

I have an issue with my eardrum, where it's perforated and will not heal on its own. I can get surgery for it, and I did, only for it to end up undone. My doctor told me that because part of my ear never fully developed, trying to seal it will just cause eardrum to get filled up with wax again, causing me to go back to having tubes again...So there's essentially no point in sealing it.

Now I know getting water in the ears is going to cause all sorts of issues, such as ear infections, imbalance, pain (massive pain), and so on. Is this obstacle something I can get around, or should I give up?

diving,"Diving equipment is the guarantee of diving safety for divers. Good-looking, fashionable and technological are all based on safety, reliability and comfort. Diving equipment can be prepared by yourself or rented on various islands.¬†Now let's take a look at what equipment to prepare for diving. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yljfbd7foc851.png?width=1135&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=93abf5fc47a7c2576a13ba0c88d724ca8fb8cf29

**Diving Mask &amp; Snorkel**

A diving mask (or dive mask/scuba mask) allows you¬†to see the breathtaking surroundings clearly under the water. The three elements of best choice are comfort, good vision, and anti-fogging.¬†The masks should be in good quality and the frame should be suitable for your face shape. 

As for snorkels, not every diver will need one. However, it‚Äôs normally suggested for beginners to carry one, while more experienced divers will see it as optional. This breathing tube comes in handy when you‚Äôre swimming facedown on the surface. In addition, snorkels also help to save the air in your tank.

**Diveskin &amp; Wetsuits**

Diveskin¬†is suitable for wearing in tropical waters. It can be worn on the inside of the wetsuits, which is convenient for taking off the wetsuits and also protecting your skin.

The thickness of wetsuits is between 1-5mm, suitable for the environment with a water temperature of 10-20 degrees. Wetsuits should fit your body (generally tighter is appropriate), provide less positive buoyancy and have good waterproof performance. 

**Fins**

Fins are generally matched with diving boots. They give you control over your movement and allow you to propel yourself through the water with speed and agility. Fins are divided into open heel and full-foot.¬†Within those two categories, it finds two more variants - blade or split.

Open heel fins are commonly used in cold water. Full-foot fins completely cover your feet and are normally used in warmer water. 

**Scuba Tank or** **Diving Cylinder**

A scuba tank or diving cylinder is another vital component of your diving gear. It stores large volumes of air, allowing you to breathe underwater. Most tanks have a maximum pressure rating of around 2000 to 3500 psi. Generally made of steel or aluminum, scuba tanks come in various styles and sizes. You can either rent them or invest in one if you plan to dive frequently.

**Regulator**

The function of the regulator is to convert the high-pressure air in the cylinder into normal-pressure air and then let us breathe. The regulator has the greatest impact on safety in all equipment.¬†It has something called a first stage, which connects to the tank or diving cylinder you wear on your back, and a second stage‚Äîthe part of the regulator that you put in your mouth. It also has a backup second stage and gauges. When choosing a regulator, comfort and performance is what you need first.

**Diving¬†Computer**

It is almost listed in the to-buy list. It is a diversified multifunctional diving instrument that can check the safety stop time, dive depth, times, too fast speed warning, NOFLY time, historical record, etc. If you connect it to some small equipment, you can also check the residual pressure.¬†Renting a dive computer can cost you more money, so it‚Äôs often better to just purchase one.

**BCD**

BCD (buoyancy control device) also called buoyancy compensator. It has three main functions: 

1. allows you to float on the water to rest or swim 

2. allows you to adjust your buoyancy when underwater

3. used as a back frame, carrying the entire scuba system on your body.

It‚Äôs basically a vest or jacket that you wear during your dive to help manage your buoyancy.

**Dive Light**

The diving flashlight can be used for night dive, cave dive¬†and fill light in daily shooting.¬†It also provides critical light when exploring cracks and crevices. Many dive lights have SOS mode, can be used to transmit signals. It is one of the necessary auxiliary tools for divers.

**Depth Gauge, Submersible Pressure Gauge &amp; Compass**

A depth gauge displays the current and maximum depth reached during a dive. A submersible pressure gauge (SPG) displays the amount of gas remaining in the scuba tank or diving cylinder, which makes you know how long you can stay underwater. Divers must develop the habit of constantly checking the SPG. A compass is used to identify the direction underwater.¬†It is very important in diving, especially when there is low visibility.

Other things you may need for diving include diving gloves, diving boots, line wheel, surface Marker Buoy (SMB), diving headgear, pointer, diving camera, a diving knife and spare mouthpiece, etc.

When I asked about this I was told that the pony tank was our redundancy and that the mask (OTS) ‚ÄúWill not fail‚Äù.  My personal opinion is that anything mechanical will fail and if there is a back up air source we should also back up our regulators.  I understand (now) that this can be a bit of a hot topic amongst divers especially in the Public Safety world.  I‚Äôve offered to buy my own Octo with my own funds and have been told that I cannot alter the main Rig.  That seems unreasonable to me.  Anyway, thoughts and opinions are welcome and any links to resources I can read to further educate myself on this subject would be great.

diving,"With budget being minimal, I'm looking at options for minimalist set ups as a beginner diver. Even though my sister and I nearly died as children drowning, I still love being under water. In pools I used to swim and sit underwater but now it hurts my ears and head to do that without anything to help. I still love being underwater. I can easily say that the only reason I go swimming is so that I can be underwater.  


Now I'd love to take a course or class but unfortunately that type of class which requires gear (in my area) and to pay for the class as well is outside of my budget. I'd barely be able to afford the gear. So I'm looking to learn super gradually myself practicing everything in a pool or shallow river. I'm here in Mid-Michigan so all we have are shallow rivers and some small lakes for swimming other than pools.  


I'd love to know my options for diving. I know Scuba and Snorkeling but I'm curious if there's anything else that could be done. Free diving is not a option for me. If I do do (hehe) snorkeling, is there a snorkel that I don't have to bite onto as I haven't any teeth. If it's scuba diving what are some options for minimalist gear?

This last year I was working on my divemaster certification (I live in NYC so there's very limited opportunities to get the dives done) while going to college. Although all that got interrupted, I fully plan on finishing up my cert. 

Recently I've been really thinking about moving to florida (maybe Fort Lauderdale area) and working in a dive shop and eventually get my instructors cert. I just don't know where to start. However, I have so many questions that I don't even know how to begin researching. Will I be able to live on being a divemaster alone or will I need a second job? What are the benefits as a divemaster? How do I even begin looking at apartments? How much money should I save up before moving?

I don't plan on moving down for another year at least. I'm gonna take a few years off college, maybe forever, and just work my ass off here and try and save up some money so I can afford everything until I get on my feet. It's never too early to research and look into things though.

I have an interest to do research on the physiological effects of breathing gases at pressure, specifically High Pressure Nervous Syndrome (HPNS). I don't have a biology or physiology background and was wondering if anyone had advice for approaching a master's program. I have a degree in Engineering Physics and will have a PhD in Aerospace Engineering. I am wondering while I'm still enrolled in the PhD program if I should be using my time to take courses in neurology or would my time be better utilized doing extracurriculars to prepare for a transition of research topics.

I‚Äôm an adept diver (have been recreationally diving yearly during the summer months) but the only gear I use is a diving mask and fins (even that ocassionally).

I‚Äôm usually able to dive to the 7-8 meter mark at most (this is without fins) and that‚Äôs usually where I start to hit the incredible ear pain mark even though I desperately try to depressurise (blowing air through my ears/opening up my Eustachian tube - sorry not a native speaker).

Since that‚Äôs the depth I can reach without fins (and just about the depth I can hold my breath for), I‚Äôm pretty certain I‚Äôd be able to dive deeper with them but I usually have to stop and go back up due to the pain..

Is there any way to train myself or depressurise more effectively so I can reach deeper? I really wanna get to all the treasures I can see. :)

diving,"Hi,

I'm looking to make a bigger investment in my diving gear (Halcyon Eclypse 30 wings, ScubaPro Jet fins, a generic backplate+harness combo, and a bag to transport it all).

Since I travel to dive, I'm looking for a bag that fits the following criteria:

* Can be checked in as luggage (I don't really care for cabin luggage for this application)
* Can be used to transport a full set of gear (my BPW, fins, mask, computer, knife; rented wetsuit, reg, weights, boots, compass, etc.) to the site, maybe with some odds and ends like a water bottle, phone, etc.
* *Ideally*, can take dunking/hosing my gear off and then draining the water - if I have a bag, it'd be great if I could do this and leave it at the dive shop overnight for the next day.

diving,"Hi there. First post here. Complete diving baby (in every sense of the word). I PETER dived last July once (loved it); had my first class last Sunday (5.5 hours with lecture and pool); had my first panic attack reading about everything that can go wrong last night (anxiety mostly assuaged by a diver friend and my instructor since then). 

Kinda surprised I haven‚Äôt found any posts on corona virus and diving in Reddit. Assuming that‚Äôs because there‚Äôs not too many reasons to be concerned unless one shares their regulator with someone else?

I decided to cancel my class today and postpone until next week just to be sure. But my instructor assured me that she disinfects regulator with bleach and water. Plus I am her only student right now and the only one using that particular set of gear. 

Of course there‚Äôs also the question if one should leave their home during a shelter order (I live in SF bay) to do something as luxurious as scuba training. 

Just wondering what folks in here have to say about all this; I‚Äôm sure there will be differing opinions and maybe some controversy?

i just got open water certified today. on my second dive, i noticed i was getting nauseous, but nothing happened. today during my 4th dive, i threw up 3 times. it wasn't a deal-breaker or anything. it just happened and i moved on.

it wasn't due to ingesting saltwater, im thinking more motion-related. i cant look at my phone too long in a moving vehicle and i get nauseous with VR headsets on. so I'm guessing this is something similar.

diving," Hi guys,

I've  got a bald head and got some minor sunburns during my last dives in  sunny regions. Therefore, I ordered several dive hoods for my next trip  to find a fitting one.

My problem  is: all size L hoods are too tight and feel uncomfortable. Even after a  couple of minutes it feels like I'll get a headache.  
XL hoods feel  good and fit easily - maybe too easily? While the diving hood closes  well on my face and lies gently on my ears, it is very loose on my neck  and even leaves some space above my skullcap.

What are the disadvantages of slightly too loose hoods? Will air get trapped inside and make my head float?  
If it matters: The material for the hood I would like to keep is 90 % Neoprene and 10 % Nylon

I'm glad for any advice / tips  
Thanks!",Disadvantages of slightly too big hood?

So as of right now I have no idea how to prevent my ear drum from popping next time I dive, however I have looked at buying ear plugs and a swim cap to make sure no water gets in my ear as I go down. Is this a viable solution? What are your inputs/suggestions?

I  did my PADI AOW last week, did 7 dives within 3 days, went 30m down for  the deep dive and another time at 30m for the ship wrek. Never had  problem equalizing or never felt any pain under the water  during or  after the dives.

Then I took my  commercial flight back home 30h after my last dive. While I was in the  plane, I noticed that my ears were making internal crackling sound,  similar of when you squeeze a sponge. It does not affect my earing but  it's really annoying. It will append if I blow my nose, if I yawn, if I  chew gun, if I try to equalize at normal pressure, sometime when I  swallow and surprisingly when I took an elevator to the 10th floor of  the building I work at.

diving,"So I‚Äôm bran new to diving and just finished my confined dives today‚Äôs. The pool is only about 12 feet deep but I was getting some pretty intense pains in my forehead just above my eyes at times. Sometimes even when we were only down at like 7 feet. I was able to kind of push through the pain and sometimes it would go away if we were down long enough, other times I had to swim back up a few feet and hope it would go away. Which it did a couple times. 

I asked a couple instructors about it and they both just said maybe my mask was on too tight but I had it pretty much as loose as I could get it.  

This is something I‚Äôd like to get figured out before my lake dives or going on my trip. I read a little bit about sinus squeeze but I really don‚Äôt know what I can do about. I‚Äôm not going to be able to continue diving if I cant get this figured out. The pain was to much at times even at 7 feet.",Sharp pain in forehead when diving.

diving,"Hey Reddit, I was hoping anyone with experience in the area of the Honduran Islands would have a suggestion about where to kill a few days outside of a dive certification course. I'm flying into Roatan on a Wednesday and not starting the dive course in Utila until Saturday. The course lasts for 4.5 days and then I don't fly out of Roatan until Sunday.   So I've got 2 full days before qualification and three full days after getting qualified that I could be open to doing just about anything.  I'm currently considering spending the first two days in Roatan and then taking the ferry to Utila the day before the course, but I suppose some time in La Ceiba could be possible if there are things to see there. Or I could go straight to Utila and just bum around for a few days if the other areas haven't got much going on and are unduly expensive to just sit in. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is there a place in the area that would be particularly good to spend a few days without diving before I start the course? After qualification would you suggest I stick around Utila to do fun dives or are there things in Roatan so worth seeing that I should head back that way to do some diving?",Extra days in the Caribbean (Roatan / Utila)

diving,"First of all, I have SSI and I'm keeping my skills up with real SCUBA, **I would not even consider this without a certification** and I am aware that many dangers of diving still apply. (Especially the need to let your breath out to avoid lung overexpansion).

Most things I enjoy in scuba happen in snorkeling range of 1-3m, however I often have found that get a good shot for photography or video I'd need 2-4 breaths worth more time. I'm thinking if I could use a Spare Air (capacity 0.42L, 57 standard breaths on surface) with the added gauge to get those shots. Are there unobvious things I should consider? I am planning snorkel/diving with my partner who would also have one (for added safety).

I specifically want something that takes a very small space in my backpack, so I know I'll bring it. I did also look at a pony as an option, but couldn't find these in my location (Finland).",Using Spare Air (0.42L) for underwater photography in 1-3m? (I have SSI)

diving,"Hey there everyone. Its my long life dream to learn how to dive, but I do have some fears, before I apply for a beginner open water course.

1. Is it smart doing the course already or would it be better doing a dive beforehand so I can see if I like diving? There are some companies offering great barrier reef dives without experience and a certification etc. but I do feel weird diving without proper training. I also never really went snorkeling in my life, so should I go snorkeling first and then see if I like it? (I got some mates snorkels to try them out in a lake and I already loved it)

2. I do am a little bit scared of sharks, but I dont think I will meet a great white shark while diving as a beginner or any other agressiv sharks ( I do want to dive with sharks once in my life)
But im kinda way more scared from the box and irukandji jellyfishes here in australia. Is there a high chance I can get stung by them while im in water?
Or am I stressing myself to much?

3. What are your guys tips to prevent panicking under water? 

4. Im also kinda scared that I fuck up and get decompression sickness. How high is the chance to fuck up? Or is it unlikely to happen if i follow the rules?

Im sorry if these questions sound dumb, but these are likely the only things that prevent me from learning how to dive.

hence currently considering it I should get another g7x mark1 (instead of mark 2 or mark 3 as they didnt fit in my existing case), or buy a gopro+case, or tg-6 + case. from what I read g7x mark 1 is still a better camera than tg-6. but tg-6 is waterproof to 15m, so in case I just jumped in and realise the case wasnt locked properly, then hurriedly lock it (like on my last dive), the camera is still safe. if I buy another g7x, just means I dont need to buy another camera case.","gopro hero 8, cannon g7x mark 1, or olympus tg-6?"
