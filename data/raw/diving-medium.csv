diving,"Howdy,

After having two trips get cancelled due to COVID travel restrictions I am going to go on my first diving trip. I'm a washington native and I grew up skin diving/snorkelling in the Puget Sound. I currently live in Michigan and I plan to do some fresh water dives to check ship wrecks. Lastly, it's my goal to try to get to the Caribbean at least once a year to try new dive spots.

Knowing this expected cadence of dives, does anyone have any suggestions for what basic gear to start picking up? I'm thinking mask and fins to start and to rent the rest. Any suggestions for a beginners mask?

Lastly, I'm interested to hear about any must see dive spots.

diving,I work as a pool and spa repair technician for a large builder in south Texas. Recently I‚Äôve been asked to take on the role of leak detector indefinitely. I have used a department suit every cold season since I‚Äôve started for light and drain repairs but only for a handful of weeks a year and was never involved in the buying process. Most were too large as I am 6‚Äô 140lbs so I would use athletic tape on the neoprene cuffs to help with a positive seal. I would love any suggestions for brands and models to look into. I was very impressed with the suits that had the gore-Tex seals. This would be for almost daily use in fall and winter at multiple jobs a day so durability and easy of entry are ideal but also something I can trust to keep me dry so I don‚Äôt drain my self burning calories to warm up. I also do not use scuba but a bonnies tankless air pump and hose with mouthpiece.,Diving For Leak Detection
diving,"The O-ring is the very important spare part on the dive light. It creates a rotating, static, and sliding seal for your dive lights, keeping components of the light safe from contaminants and flooding. When you dive in salt water or murky water, tiny particles may work their way into the seal, leading to a leak. So it needs regular cleaning and maintenance for O-rings.

Start by soaking the light in fresh water to to dissolve the majority of the dried salt at the seal. Dry the gear and open it. Then, by pinching the O-ring between your thumb and forefinger, remove the O-ring with your fingers. Do not use anything sharp or metallic. 

Once the o-ring is safely removed, wipe all dirt and grease from the ring using a soft¬†and clean¬†cloth. Inspect the o-ring for cuts, nicks and any signs of wear. Replace the O-ring if its worn or damaged. 

To lubricate the o-ring, place a small dab of silicon grease on your fingers and run your fingers over the o-ring until it‚Äôs evenly coated and shiny. Make sure that¬†it‚Äôs¬†greased enough but not too greasy either. An O-ring which has been lubricated properly is smooth and slick with grease. This lets it properly slide into the groove on the dive light and create a nice, tight seal.  

There is video about O-ring maintenance for your reference:

diving,"Primary light is the one you generally use, and if the primary light fails during a dive, you switch to a backup light. What are the differences between them? 

The primary dive lights should be:

* They are robust and powerful.
* They have long burn times.
* They are higher in power, and brighter for deeper uses.

The secondary dive lights usually are:

* They are more compact, smaller and lighter in weight.
* They have shorter burn times.
* They are typically less powerful, but sufficient enough to serve as a backup.

Carrying a backup light on your dive is a good idea. You never know when your primary dive light will die out, or if you are going on longer dives, it‚Äôs always worthwhile to have a secondary dive light with you for those deeper, darker depths you plan going through. For example, you can take [D26 1600](https://www.xtar.cc/product/XTAR-D26-1600-Diving-Flashlight-43.html) as your primary dive light and [D20 1000](https://www.xtar.cc/product/XTAR-D20-1000-Diving-Flashlight-143.html) as your secondary light.

diving,"Many u/w photographers like the Macro shooting for the creatures. Usually the strobes are the primary lighting tools for you. But do you know your backup dive light can also do it? With proper position and composition, you can shot unique images without the extra cost of a strobe. 

Why? As you know, the Macro shooting is shot the macro subjects up close. Only a single point of light is needed to illuminate the macro creatures and make them show their original colors. That's enough. In that case, a dive torch with narrow beams can do it.

Using this dive torch to create a spotlight, you can actually see the beam range before shooting a picture. ¬†

Bright your dive light around the side of the subject, rather than head-on. It can create the slide lighting. It could accentuate textures and make the image a bit moodier. Handy dive light works well especially for subjects in the sand such as stargazer and seahorses, which aren‚Äôt too skittish to move if you place a dive torch close by. 

Dive torches can also be used to backlight for sedentary subjects. If the subject doesn‚Äôt move at all, then you can simply rest the torch in the sand or an empty spot. However, if the subject is swimming or in the water column, then you‚Äôll need another diver to hold the light.

I am newbie so pardon my ignorance - I am getting my certificate later this month. I live in South Florida and my best friend, who is an avid diver, is getting married late Spring 2021. He's been trying to get me into diving for years but between work, travel, baby, money... it took a push. The push came in the form of a diving trip bachelor party for 7 days and an expected 25+ dives. I am jumping in head first - I want to buy some equipment and get taught in that equipment. The bachelor party diving will be happening(covid willing) in St. Lucia or the like in Feb/March 2021.

Here's where I need help. I have done extensive research and have narrowed down two different setups for BCD but I am stuck between the two. If you've made it this far and you area an experienced diver - maybe you can help - and thank you in advance if you can.

I like the simple approach of wing, backplate and harness. I have no interest in a jacket style BCD. I will almost exclusively be diving the Caribbean or south Florida for the foreseeable future. I am 5'11"" and 190lbs and a strong swimmer (don't know if any of that is relevant)

**Q: Do I get the Apeks One piece harness WITH the SS Apeks backplate +Apeks WTX D30 wing or WITH aluminum Apeks backplate + Apeks WTX D18 wing?**

I plan on using a standard weight belt that I use for lobstering/pole fishing for lead. I have 16lbs in 2lbs increments and a standard rubber belt. I don't know how many pounds I will need yet to be zero buoyant. I will be using neoprene tech shorts for storage. Again - don't know if any of this helps.

I will be traveling with it but the weight difference of 5lbs doesn't seem to make a difference between alum and SS in the backplate. I would simply use the SS as more weight requiring less for my belt. I chose those combinations thinking that would be the most efficient combo --- I could be wrong and correct me if I am not. If I missed the mark entirely - please provide constructive criticism and tell me what I should get. :- )

Side note: I am leaning towards the aluminum backplate and 18lb wing as my wife (5'5"" and 130 lbs) could potentially use it if it's not enough lift for me so potentially no harm - no foul.

I am about to buy a diving computer as I plan to get more serious about diving (currently at advanced level, 25 dives).

Initially I wanted to buy the Cressi Giotto diving computer (many recommendations, bit better than his little brother the Leonardo model and quite affordable).

Now, I stumpled upon Suunto's D5 during some research. I was immedialy stunned by its modern yet simplistic information interface. I don't know if you relate you it, but I find some diving computer displays a bit tricky to read.. it's seems a little crammed sometimes. The Suunto clearly has more modern featuers and looks. However, it's also double in price.

My question is, do you think it's worth investing in the Suunto D5 model? If you have experience with it, what are your thoughts and would you recommend it? Is it worth double the price of the Cressi Giotto?

Back in December, I was on a dive with a lot of surge bringing me up and down and my ear started to not feel right. According to DAN resources, all signs pointed to a middle ear barotrauma. As I was not in my home state (yay US health care!), I couldn‚Äôt afford to see an out of network MD until I got home. Between work, COVID, required referrals in the US, and appts being booked months away, it took A WHILE to finally get seen by an ENT (today‚Ä¶). 

Back in December, on my flight home, I had SEVERE pain in my ear. Thankfully the flight was quick. Since then, the pain has only been a dull ache for the most part but certain things set it off to being more painful like cold/wind/water/loud noises/physically pushing on my ear. Trying to swim in a cold lake recently and my ear was very uncomfortable. I‚Äôve been taking Flonase daily for the last couple months to no avail 

Flash-forward to today. I get a hearing test and the results are normal. I get an ENT to look into my ears and nose and throat and that‚Äôs all normal. He can‚Äôt figure it out. Says I have no fluid, no infection...

I just want to be able to dive again but if it hurts to swim at the surface, I‚Äôm sure down with pressure will be extra painful! Free diving a few feet below the surface HURTS.

diving,"Hello people.

I recently started the search for a backplate/wing setup. I noticed some companies tend to offer 2 types of straps. The basic type that need to be set up once and kept the same for all dives and the ""deluxe"" versions. Versions that have clips like a regular bcd to offer easyer adjustment and are more targeted towards rec divers.
(example: xdeep zen VS xdeep zen deluxe) 

What are your opinions about those ""deluxe"" versions?
I'm a rec diver and often change between a 7mm wetsuit and a 7mm with an extra 7mm on top. Thus I was thinking of getting an adjustable one. However I read on some forums that it's not at all needed even for a change in wetsuit.
Any divers here with some experience on this topic?

The thing is, I've just catched a couple planes, and I spent the whole flight not equalized until it went down, and the second one was fine until it went down, gosh my ears never hurt so bad. I know 3 ways to equalize, plus my own way, and none were the tiniest bit useful.

So, I'm currently based in the UK and dive a handful of times a year when travelling for fun and work (outdoor instructor and expedition leader) 

Thing is, as cash is always tight I either borrow or rely on my dive buddies for computer related info.

However, I'm about to move to Dakar and plan on working through my certs over the next year or so (Currently only OW) but would like to equip myself with a computer from a UK based company (cost, warranty, repair etc will be easier this way when I visit the home) that will work for me at my current level but also be suitable on my journey through the certs. (End goal is definitely dive instruction for more international employment oppos)

Have used Suunto Zoops so far and like them, if that helps.

Phone was in a plastic case that helped protect it from getting wet but the MicroSD card was not working as I tried to get some info from that first.

diving,"Hello there,

i have a (stupid?) question on diving or underwater swimming in the local swimming pool at a maximal depth of 2, maybe 3 meters.

Short things first I have ear problems on both my ears, but especially on my right one, where the ear drum is deformed and has scars on it, which gives a feeling of permanent ear pressure or.. inflammation or something like that.
Since I really love swimming and diving in low water Situations but kinda cannot because of this reason.

Now my question is: 

Can I go diving / swimming under water with ear plugs, that don't have a membrane for water pressure in it? Or is it too dangerous to do it like that. 
My ear plugs would be made at my hearing aid provider with a perfect fit ear plug for around 80‚Ç¨ made of some sort od silicon or rubber like material.

If not, are there any serious alternatives to that? Ive read about plugs with holes / specific membranes in it that helped a lot of people, but wasn't sure if it helped in my case.. 

Im sorry for the dumb question, since I think this sub isn't particularly the right for my purposes. 
It would be maximum 3 meters of depth. And even if I wanted to do snorling im reefs it would be around the same depth. 
And sorry for my bad english, it isn't my Mother language.

I have $250 to spend on snorkel, fins, and mask. Would rather spend money once than upgrade in in 12 months using student loan money, so I'd love for it to be stuff I can grow in to.

Mask-- female, medium size face I guess? Accepting any and all recommendations.

Snorkel-- I've gotten the sense from reading that dry is a bad idea for freediving; what about semi-dry?

I love to free dive and lobster dive during the season and have been doing so for around 4-5 years now. I used to be able to hit 50ft(15m) every dive pretty easy up until about two years ago, for some reason I began having trouble equalizing and now can max out at 50ft(15m) on my first 1-3 dives and then usually end up diving no deeper than 10-20ft(3-6m) depending on the day. 

My left ear feels totally fine, however my right ear is having problems, when I put my finger just under where my ear starts(just below the earlobe) and where the top of my jaw flexes it feels like theres a tiny pea sized air bubble there and isn't there on the left side.

I'm wondering if anyone has heard or experienced this themselves as I think it might be the cause to my problems if it is affecting my Eustachian tube. Its been there for about 2 years now(at least thats when I noticed it) and I'm wondering what it is.

I have an issue with my eardrum, where it's perforated and will not heal on its own. I can get surgery for it, and I did, only for it to end up undone. My doctor told me that because part of my ear never fully developed, trying to seal it will just cause eardrum to get filled up with wax again, causing me to go back to having tubes again...So there's essentially no point in sealing it.

Now I know getting water in the ears is going to cause all sorts of issues, such as ear infections, imbalance, pain (massive pain), and so on. Is this obstacle something I can get around, or should I give up?

A few weeks back I suffered from a spontaneous collapsed lung while running. Strange, because I am a fit and generally healthy person. Also a CT scan showed pretty normal lungs. Anyways, I'm getting chemical pleurodesis to prevent collapses from happening again. My surgeon even offered me, after some begging from my side, the option to do surgery on both sides, so both lungs have smaller chance of collapsing and I get medically cleared to dive and start my initiation course as scuba dive instructor.

&amp;#x200B;

Before I take the tempting offer, I would like to hear from you! Someone here with similar lung issues and had pleurodesis to fix it? Did you scuba dive after?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks ü§ç",Spontaneous lung collapse/pneumothorax

diving,"Diving equipment is the guarantee of diving safety for divers. Good-looking, fashionable and technological are all based on safety, reliability and comfort. Diving equipment can be prepared by yourself or rented on various islands.¬†Now let's take a look at what equipment to prepare for diving. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yljfbd7foc851.png?width=1135&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=93abf5fc47a7c2576a13ba0c88d724ca8fb8cf29

**Diving Mask &amp; Snorkel**

A diving mask (or dive mask/scuba mask) allows you¬†to see the breathtaking surroundings clearly under the water. The three elements of best choice are comfort, good vision, and anti-fogging.¬†The masks should be in good quality and the frame should be suitable for your face shape. 

As for snorkels, not every diver will need one. However, it‚Äôs normally suggested for beginners to carry one, while more experienced divers will see it as optional. This breathing tube comes in handy when you‚Äôre swimming facedown on the surface. In addition, snorkels also help to save the air in your tank.

**Diveskin &amp; Wetsuits**

Diveskin¬†is suitable for wearing in tropical waters. It can be worn on the inside of the wetsuits, which is convenient for taking off the wetsuits and also protecting your skin.

The thickness of wetsuits is between 1-5mm, suitable for the environment with a water temperature of 10-20 degrees. Wetsuits should fit your body (generally tighter is appropriate), provide less positive buoyancy and have good waterproof performance. 

**Fins**

Fins are generally matched with diving boots. They give you control over your movement and allow you to propel yourself through the water with speed and agility. Fins are divided into open heel and full-foot.¬†Within those two categories, it finds two more variants - blade or split.

Open heel fins are commonly used in cold water. Full-foot fins completely cover your feet and are normally used in warmer water. 

**Scuba Tank or** **Diving Cylinder**

A scuba tank or diving cylinder is another vital component of your diving gear. It stores large volumes of air, allowing you to breathe underwater. Most tanks have a maximum pressure rating of around 2000 to 3500 psi. Generally made of steel or aluminum, scuba tanks come in various styles and sizes. You can either rent them or invest in one if you plan to dive frequently.

**Regulator**

The function of the regulator is to convert the high-pressure air in the cylinder into normal-pressure air and then let us breathe. The regulator has the greatest impact on safety in all equipment.¬†It has something called a first stage, which connects to the tank or diving cylinder you wear on your back, and a second stage‚Äîthe part of the regulator that you put in your mouth. It also has a backup second stage and gauges. When choosing a regulator, comfort and performance is what you need first.

**Diving¬†Computer**

It is almost listed in the to-buy list. It is a diversified multifunctional diving instrument that can check the safety stop time, dive depth, times, too fast speed warning, NOFLY time, historical record, etc. If you connect it to some small equipment, you can also check the residual pressure.¬†Renting a dive computer can cost you more money, so it‚Äôs often better to just purchase one.

**BCD**

BCD (buoyancy control device) also called buoyancy compensator. It has three main functions: 

1. allows you to float on the water to rest or swim 

2. allows you to adjust your buoyancy when underwater

3. used as a back frame, carrying the entire scuba system on your body.

It‚Äôs basically a vest or jacket that you wear during your dive to help manage your buoyancy.

**Dive Light**

The diving flashlight can be used for night dive, cave dive¬†and fill light in daily shooting.¬†It also provides critical light when exploring cracks and crevices. Many dive lights have SOS mode, can be used to transmit signals. It is one of the necessary auxiliary tools for divers.

**Depth Gauge, Submersible Pressure Gauge &amp; Compass**

A depth gauge displays the current and maximum depth reached during a dive. A submersible pressure gauge (SPG) displays the amount of gas remaining in the scuba tank or diving cylinder, which makes you know how long you can stay underwater. Divers must develop the habit of constantly checking the SPG. A compass is used to identify the direction underwater.¬†It is very important in diving, especially when there is low visibility.

Other things you may need for diving include diving gloves, diving boots, line wheel, surface Marker Buoy (SMB), diving headgear, pointer, diving camera, a diving knife and spare mouthpiece, etc.

diving,"I just received my Dive Rig a few days ago and noticed that it doesn‚Äôt come outfitted with an Octo.  When I asked about this I was told that the pony tank was our redundancy and that the mask (OTS) ‚ÄúWill not fail‚Äù.  My personal opinion is that anything mechanical will fail and if there is a back up air source we should also back up our regulators.  I understand (now) that this can be a bit of a hot topic amongst divers especially in the Public Safety world.  I‚Äôve offered to buy my own Octo with my own funds and have been told that I cannot alter the main Rig.  That seems unreasonable to me.  Anyway, thoughts and opinions are welcome and any links to resources I can read to further educate myself on this subject would be great.

diving,"With budget being minimal, I'm looking at options for minimalist set ups as a beginner diver. Even though my sister and I nearly died as children drowning, I still love being under water. In pools I used to swim and sit underwater but now it hurts my ears and head to do that without anything to help. I still love being underwater. I can easily say that the only reason I go swimming is so that I can be underwater.  


Now I'd love to take a course or class but unfortunately that type of class which requires gear (in my area) and to pay for the class as well is outside of my budget. I'd barely be able to afford the gear. So I'm looking to learn super gradually myself practicing everything in a pool or shallow river. I'm here in Mid-Michigan so all we have are shallow rivers and some small lakes for swimming other than pools.  


I'd love to know my options for diving. I know Scuba and Snorkeling but I'm curious if there's anything else that could be done. Free diving is not a option for me. If I do do (hehe) snorkeling, is there a snorkel that I don't have to bite onto as I haven't any teeth. If it's scuba diving what are some options for minimalist gear? Complete bigger but I'd love to take my love for being underwater to the next level.

This last year I was working on my divemaster certification (I live in NYC so there's very limited opportunities to get the dives done) while going to college. Although all that got interrupted, I fully plan on finishing up my cert. 

Recently I've been really thinking about moving to florida (maybe Fort Lauderdale area) and working in a dive shop and eventually get my instructors cert. I just don't know where to start. However, I have so many questions that I don't even know how to begin researching. Will I be able to live on being a divemaster alone or will I need a second job? What are the benefits as a divemaster? How do I even begin looking at apartments? How much money should I save up before moving?

I don't plan on moving down for another year at least. I'm gonna take a few years off college, maybe forever, and just work my ass off here and try and save up some money so I can afford everything until I get on my feet. It's never too early to research and look into things though.

I‚Äôm an adept diver (have been recreationally diving yearly during the summer months) but the only gear I use is a diving mask and fins (even that ocassionally).

I‚Äôm usually able to dive to the 7-8 meter mark at most (this is without fins) and that‚Äôs usually where I start to hit the incredible ear pain mark even though I desperately try to depressurise (blowing air through my ears/opening up my Eustachian tube - sorry not a native speaker).

Since that‚Äôs the depth I can reach without fins (and just about the depth I can hold my breath for), I‚Äôm pretty certain I‚Äôd be able to dive deeper with them but I usually have to stop and go back up due to the pain..

I'm looking to make a bigger investment in my diving gear (Halcyon Eclypse 30 wings, ScubaPro Jet fins, a generic backplate+harness combo, and a bag to transport it all).

Since I travel to dive, I'm looking for a bag that fits the following criteria:

* Can be checked in as luggage (I don't really care for cabin luggage for this application)
* Can be used to transport a full set of gear (my BPW, fins, mask, computer, knife; rented wetsuit, reg, weights, boots, compass, etc.) to the site, maybe with some odds and ends like a water bottle, phone, etc.
* *Ideally*, can take dunking/hosing my gear off and then draining the water - if I have a bag, it'd be great if I could do this and leave it at the dive shop overnight for the next day.

I PETER dived last July once (loved it); had my first class last Sunday (5.5 hours with lecture and pool); had my first panic attack reading about everything that can go wrong last night (anxiety mostly assuaged by a diver friend and my instructor since then). 

Kinda surprised I haven‚Äôt found any posts on corona virus and diving in Reddit. Assuming that‚Äôs because there‚Äôs not too many reasons to be concerned unless one shares their regulator with someone else?

I decided to cancel my class today and postpone until next week just to be sure. But my instructor assured me that she disinfects regulator with bleach and water. Plus I am her only student right now and the only one using that particular set of gear. 

Of course there‚Äôs also the question if one should leave their home during a shelter order (I live in SF bay) to do something as luxurious as scuba training. 

Just wondering what folks in here have to say about all this; I‚Äôm sure there will be differing opinions and maybe some controversy?

diving," Hi guys,

I've  got a bald head and got some minor sunburns during my last dives in  sunny regions. Therefore, I ordered several dive hoods for my next trip  to find a fitting one.

My problem  is: all size L hoods are too tight and feel uncomfortable. Even after a  couple of minutes it feels like I'll get a headache.  
XL hoods feel  good and fit easily - maybe too easily? While the diving hood closes  well on my face and lies gently on my ears, it is very loose on my neck  and even leaves some space above my skullcap.

What are the disadvantages of slightly too loose hoods? Will air get trapped inside and make my head float?  
If it matters: The material for the hood I would like to keep is 90 % Neoprene and 10 % Nylon

I'm glad for any advice / tips

So as of right now I have no idea how to prevent my ear drum from popping next time I dive, however I have looked at buying ear plugs and a swim cap to make sure no water gets in my ear as I go down. Is this a viable solution? What are your inputs/suggestions?

I  did my PADI AOW last week, did 7 dives within 3 days, went 30m down for  the deep dive and another time at 30m for the ship wrek. Never had  problem equalizing or never felt any pain under the water  during or  after the dives.

Then I took my  commercial flight back home 30h after my last dive. While I was in the  plane, I noticed that my ears were making internal crackling sound,  similar of when you squeeze a sponge. It does not affect my earing but  it's really annoying. It will append if I blow my nose, if I yawn, if I  chew gun, if I try to equalize at normal pressure, sometime when I  swallow and surprisingly when I took an elevator to the 10th floor of  the building I work at.

I got my PADI open water license in winter of 2017-2018, but I haven't been diving since. I am going on a trip to Fiji in May and \*before\* I get there I was hoping to take a refresher course. I am going to San Padre Island, TX for a work trip next week (so in early February) and am considering extending for the weekend to go diving there (and to maybe take that refresher course there). Is there good diving there? Is there just as good (or better, or cheaper) diving if I dip into Mexico for the weekend? Are there places that offer refresher courses in the ocean as opposed to in a pool?

diving,"So I‚Äôm bran new to diving and just finished my confined dives today‚Äôs. The pool is only about 12 feet deep but I was getting some pretty intense pains in my forehead just above my eyes at times. Sometimes even when we were only down at like 7 feet. I was able to kind of push through the pain and sometimes it would go away if we were down long enough, other times I had to swim back up a few feet and hope it would go away. Which it did a couple times. 

I asked a couple instructors about it and they both just said maybe my mask was on too tight but I had it pretty much as loose as I could get it.  

This is something I‚Äôd like to get figured out before my lake dives or going on my trip. I read a little bit about sinus squeeze but I really don‚Äôt know what I can do about.

diving,"Hey Reddit, I was hoping anyone with experience in the area of the Honduran Islands would have a suggestion about where to kill a few days outside of a dive certification course. I'm flying into Roatan on a Wednesday and not starting the dive course in Utila until Saturday. The course lasts for 4.5 days and then I don't fly out of Roatan until Sunday.   So I've got 2 full days before qualification and three full days after getting qualified that I could be open to doing just about anything.  I'm currently considering spending the first two days in Roatan and then taking the ferry to Utila the day before the course, but I suppose some time in La Ceiba could be possible if there are things to see there. Or I could go straight to Utila and just bum around for a few days if the other areas haven't got much going on and are unduly expensive to just sit in. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is there a place in the area that would be particularly good to spend a few days without diving before I start the course? After qualification would you suggest I stick around Utila to do fun dives or are there things in Roatan so worth seeing that I should head back that way to do some diving?",Extra days in the Caribbean (Roatan / Utila)

diving,"First of all, I have SSI and I'm keeping my skills up with real SCUBA, **I would not even consider this without a certification** and I am aware that many dangers of diving still apply. (Especially the need to let your breath out to avoid lung overexpansion).

Most things I enjoy in scuba happen in snorkeling range of 1-3m, however I often have found that get a good shot for photography or video I'd need 2-4 breaths worth more time. I'm thinking if I could use a Spare Air (capacity 0.42L, 57 standard breaths on surface) with the added gauge to get those shots. Are there unobvious things I should consider? I am planning snorkel/diving with my partner who would also have one (for added safety).

diving,"Hey there everyone. Its my long life dream to learn how to dive, but I do have some fears, before I apply for a beginner open water course.

1. Is it smart doing the course already or would it be better doing a dive beforehand so I can see if I like diving? There are some companies offering great barrier reef dives without experience and a certification etc. but I do feel weird diving without proper training. I also never really went snorkeling in my life, so should I go snorkeling first and then see if I like it? (I got some mates snorkels to try them out in a lake and I already loved it)

2. I do am a little bit scared of sharks, but I dont think I will meet a great white shark while diving as a beginner or any other agressiv sharks ( I do want to dive with sharks once in my life)
But im kinda way more scared from the box and irukandji jellyfishes here in australia. Is there a high chance I can get stung by them while im in water?
Or am I stressing myself to much?

3. What are your guys tips to prevent panicking under water? 

4. Im also kinda scared that I fuck up and get decompression sickness. How high is the chance to fuck up? Or is it unlikely to happen if i follow the rules?

Im sorry if these questions sound dumb, but these are likely the only things that prevent me from learning how to dive.

I'm in Thailand towards the end of Feb and early March next year and looking to leave the hotel for a few days on a liveaboard to dive The Similan Islands/Richelieu Rock. I was looking to book with [Liveaboard.com](https://Liveaboard.com) but reading their Trustpilot has made me extremely wary of using them to book. 

This will be my first time on a liveaboard and I'll be travelling alone, so want to make sure I get the booking side of things right!

I want to use it to dive in water of around 20 degrees Celsius but also in more tropical waters. The hood probably is not necessary but it might be more comfortable when doing multiple dives on a day.

diving,"Hello all,

As per the title, I have always wanted to do a liveaboard (Komodo, Raja Ampat, Galapagos are all high up on my bucketlists), but I know I have a seasickness problem. I would classify it as moderate; I get nauseous aboard small boats (5-7m long) after 15 to 30 minutes and have thrown up due to seasickness before. Larger/faster boats tend to be okay. I've tried ginger pills, Stugeron but they don't usually do much to alleviate my symptoms.

Because of this, I have often limited myself to places where I know dive sites are close by (Gili T in Indonesia has been my major haunt) but I figured I would quite like to take the next step in my diving hobby.

I am rather apprehensive of spending a large sum of money of these liveaboards only to be seasick the entire time; but from what I gather, these boats are pretty large so I might just be okay.

diving,"Hi Everyone, 

This coming early February my Partner and I would like to do our first liveaboard. I've been diving for a few years now (East Coast Australia (Not GBR), Mexico (West Coast), and the Andamans), I have Padi Advanced. My partner she is knew to diving and has recently completed her SSI Open Water. 

We've been tossing up a few ideas, which I think might be the problem (spoilt for choice). I'm really after a nice experience (visibility, good weather, easy diving, friendly instructors) over a technical experience. 5 to 7 nights would be optimal (I think, happy to field advice though).

What we have thought about:

1. Similian Islands Thailand 

 \- Con: Many options (some are very expensive (diva andaman) (equivalent price to Maldives) 

 \- Con: Mixed Reviews (overcrowding, poor vis, itineraries not very thorough)

 \- Pro: Thailand is beautiful and relatively easy to get to from east coast AUS. Lots to do either side of liveaboard.

2. Phillipines 

 \- Pro/Con: Always wanted to go, but not sure what it's like. (stuff to do either side of liveaboard etc?)

 \- Pro: Seems well priced. Lots of options

 \- Bit harder to get too.

3. Maldives

 \- Pro: Partner Always wanted to go.

 \- Con: Not much to do either side of liveaboard.

 \- Pro: Visibility

 \- Mixed Reviews

 \- Con: Expensive 

 \- Expensive/hard to get too.

4. Raja Ampat

 \- Pro: Highly recommended

 \- Pro: Liveaboards are well priced, rave reviews. 

 \- Very hard and expensive get too. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm would be happy to hear any suggestions/tips/advice. Also what I have written above may or may not be correct, its just my general position from a few days deep diving through information. 

I'm especially interested in what folks think is the best place for this time of year and places I should definitely rule out because of lack of experience or poor timing. 

We've also considered going locally for a liveaboard experience on the GBR, so open to suggestions there.

Some of you may remember me from the summer, ""spamming"" this subreddit with surveys related to an [idea](https://www.reddit.com/r/diving/comments/c9rbtk/idea_global_dive_site_directory/) I had after almost not being able to complete my NAUI Master in Okinawa due to the rainy season kicking down the door and forcing several dive sites closed just as we were getting there.

So I floated the idea of a dive site directory where you can quickly pull weather reports (tide, currents, temperature), astronomical times (for planning night dives), and reports by local divers (waves, currents, temp, viz). Feedback was mixed, but I decided what the heck, and made the app. Now, I'm gearing up for the beta and the first release, and I'm looking to get as diverse a base as I can - all sorts of devices and use cases, see where the app performs best and worst.

I have gone through several phases of feeling helpless, angry, and sad about it. My accident was stupid, and doctors really didn't help me that well - the first one gave me some bad advice that ended up being the reason why my tinnitus didn't go away, the second one is nice but tries to scare me into never diving again. 

Right now it is hard to imagine what my relationship with the ocean will be like in the future, but considering how much my ENT doctor has scared me, I decided to at least start to try to get peace with the idea of only snorkeling in the future.

diving,"TIA / TL;DR : What is a fool proof way of ensuring that water does not enter the ear while snorkeling? Not concerned with the cost, but rather the effectiveness. 

My girlfriend and I are going to the Maldives in 40 days and I plan to snorkel daily, but she is worried about snorkeling due to an experience she had 6 years ago when she got water in her ear and had 8 months of tinnitus / voice echoing with doctors unsure of the cause (no rupture or infection) and they just ended up recommending long term Sudafed or to try higher salt intake. She hasn‚Äôt put her head underwater or swam since then due to how bad it was for those 8 months. 

I‚Äôm trying to find a solution to get her comfortable with snorkeling, but am not trying to push too hard. She has never gone snorkeling before, but knows there‚Äôs obviously a risk of water getting into the ears. 

I found an ear mask by IST called the Pro Ear, but with her long hair and no pressure at surface to hold the seal tight, I‚Äôm not sure how effective this would be. I read that combining this with wax ear plugs would be more effective however. 

I am trying to get as close to 0% risk of water entering her ear as possible and am hoping this sub-reddit can help me show her that snorkeling is safe and incredible to witness in the Maldives (hope to see Whale shark, Manta Rays, Eagle Rays, and more). We would be doing light snorkeling, nothing with choppy waves and would descent from the boat slowly at sea to try and limit any jumping in causing water to rush into the ear. 

So, does anyone have any suggestions? I am sure there are many with long hair that must have had ear issues temporarily or permanently that found solutions to the same problem I am trying to solve.

However, in the inside of the wetsuit is warns to not use it for diving.

diving,"Lets get it out the way first, yes its a stupid idea. I have made those a bit of a life habit and so being a stupid idea doesn't mean too much. i'd rather focus on the practicalities of whether it's possible or not. 

I've devoted my life to trying to create more community and human connection for the past 10 years, and have an event i want to publicise which would do a lot of good for everyone in the world.

It appears there is a window in the [Lobourg Channel](http://www.sussex.ac.uk/geography/researchprojects/coastview/Offshore/offshore.htm) creating a route where the maximum depth is between 30 and 40m, possibly a few meters deeper. 

I estimate it would take between 24 and 36hrs to complete if i can keep a decent speed, which isn't far out of the range professional underwater welders sometimes do during heavy overtime. 

While researching i came across a [mad scotsman](https://divingalmanac.com/underwater-marathon/) who did an underwater marathon at up to 30m depth in Loch Ness. Although he did it in 4hr bursts over 12 days.

I'd be intending to do it one sustained walk so i'd be down there a lot longer and around 10m deeper at some points. He was also using an old fashioned diving suit - with a kind sponsor i could probably have something far more mobile.

I guess a boat in shipping routes can be resolved as it is for those who swim the channel

The seabed seems to be mostly [course sand and pebbles](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Seabed-sediment-types-extracted-from-a-digital-version-of-the-sediment-map-of-the-English_fig7_278643613)

I was thinking a diving helmet and dry suit. attached to a boat on the surface pumping oxygen down, with a spare tank along with me with enough air to surface if oxygen was cut off from the boat.

** Potentially Insurmountable Issues **

- I've been unable to really gauge how much the current would effect someone walking along the bottom at that depth, especially crossing the Loubough Channel, as there are deep pools i could be swept into.
- There are large sand banks to walk up, which might simply not be possible underwater.
- The cliffs of the Loubough Channel. I'm not sure how steep these are and if they would require actual climbing, which is probably a bit dangerous with a tube above you going up to the surface.

I'd need to find sponsors for the kit and boat. Any other factors you can see which would make this impossible, or should be accounted for.",Is it possible to walk across the bottom of the English Channel from Dover to Calais?
diving,"Ok, it's an odd title. I was snorkelling yesterday. Well, I tried but found the loop that holds the snorkel to the goggles was missing. Tried attaching it to the strap somehow but still somehow manage to lose the snorkel, and found it didn't swim. Tried to search for it, but never liked pressure in the goggles on my eyes when going too deep. So I left them on a rock in the end and finally found the snorkel about 5m down in some seaweed. 

Long story, but why do people say that salt water stings in the eyes? I never had that issue. Does it really sting and my eyes are odd, or do people just expect it to sting? I'm currently in the very warm eastern Mediterranean, which is more salty than most oceans but also don't have problems in the shallows on the Persian Gulf, which is even saltier. I only have problems with pools that contain way too much chloride. I can evidently also see quite well under water :)",[sea]water + eyes = who cares

diving,"I am a relatively new diver (~20 dives), am trying to work out the kinks so I make as little mistakes as possible.

Had 4 dives yesterday aboard a liveaboard with an experienced guide, had a mild headache 20 mins into my 4th dive.  I took Tylenol after I came up and it went away quick. All dives were within 15-25 metres max. My instructor said it was because my breath was too shallow.

I've had a really bad headache before a few months ago during my AOW lessons on my 3rd dive to 30 metres, so I thought it was normal.  That one was due to dehydration.

This time, I hydrated throughout the day, took electrolytes, counted my breaths etc. But this is the 1st dive of the day, when I was down at 28ish metres diving a wreck, I felt my throat tighten and get very dry.  I was unable to swallow and felt like I was choking up in general. This was about 10 minutes in. I let the instructor know and I felt this way for the entire 30 mins dive. Then I threw up into the regulator during our safety stop despite not eating anything that morning.

What could have happened? I must admit I was a little panicky because of the whole dry mouth and being unable to swallow thing.

diving,"Today I dived for the first time. It was essentially a dive to see if people are comfortable in the water diving, before being let onto the Scuba Air Diver course that im going on for work. 

The dive works by jumping off the wharf, going down 1 metre, filling up the mask and purging, removing the mask and putting it back on, then removing the respirator and buddy breathing. 

I got down to 1 metre, but as went down i struggled to be able to breathe without swallowing a lot of water. Then when i let water into the mask to purge it, it started feeling like i couldnt breathe at all. I was told i didnt have a tight enough seal around the respirator, and that I was subconciously breathing through my nose when water came into the mask. I ended up failing the suitability, and have another shot in 2 weeks.

Ive bought a snorkel and fins to practise being comfortable and confident breathing underwater and purging the mask. Planning on going to the pool or beach everyday after work to practise.

diving,"I had been diving in Bonaire a couple years ago and was excited to dive in Aruba last week, but I was somewhat disappointed by how different the reef conditions are.  Every spot I dove in Aruba had tons of healthy hard coral, good visibility and lots of species of fish and invertebrates. I only dove in two places in Aruba (it was a family vacation and I only had half a day for diving) but the conditions were drastically different. The visibility was not terrible but not great (maybe 30ft), the reefs were patchy and mostly soft corals, and the number of fish and invertebrate species was much less than in Bonaire. It reminded my of diving in Florida north of the Keys.   


I know that Bonaire is an especially well preserved reef for the Caribbean, but I was wondering whether I just went to wrong spots in Aruba (Star Garren and Pedernalis). Are there spur-and-groove or fringe reefs in Aruba that I missed? My in-laws love Aruba, so it is likely that we will be going back next year and I'd like to pick better spots for diving.

diving,"Hey, wondering opinions on a new bcd. I‚Äôm a fairly new (2 years) OWD, planning to do advanced and some specialty courses in the next couple of years. I live in Canada, with very cold local water but do most of my dives down in the Caribbean or (hopefully) Pacific Ocean in the future. I‚Äôm looking at Hollis (specifically the HD-200 and tek travel packages) because they have a sale, and seem to have what I‚Äôm looking for, they also include a good reg/octo and gauge.

Any experience with these? Or other suggestions? The tek travel bcd seems to be more geared towards warm water, Will it survive cold? open to other BCD‚Äôs but want something lighter/able to travel.

diving,"Hi guys, I'm doing my DM course right now. Last weekend I was assisting in the Rescue Diver course and the instructor asked me to lead one module under her supervision to check if working with people is for me and to put me in her shoes. I must admit, I loved it so much, the students and instructor were very happy and grateful for my contribution, that's made me even more to become OWSI/MSDT.

&amp;#x200B;

So right now I am really considering to do OWSI and work as Instructor as my hobby/side job - I know my instructors could answer all my question but it varies in different parts of the world.

1. DiveMaster salary/earnings. How much can earn daily (?)/weekly doing Fun Dives and DCD?
2. OWSI salary/earnings. Based on my experiences most cash goes to DiveCenter/School owner.   
How much is left for the instructor? / Are they mostly full-time jobs?
3. Any other forms of earning? DiveShop etc?
4. Would you recommend going to full-time OWSI or keep it as a hobby/side job?
5. What, In your opinion, I should know that can change my mind in doing OWSI/MSDT?

Well, I still wanted to dive and organised a trip with a friend of mine a few weeks ago. I was really nervous about it but did a lot of research and found a great diving center (Divewise in Malta) who took my friend and I out in a pair. I stuck close to the instructor and he gave me a lot of support and made me feel very safe. 

The first dive was more terrifying than enjoyable but I did have moments of 'wow this is incredible'. But after the first dive, I realised I'd actually done quite a good job controlling my position and a lot of my nervousness went away. I asked for feedback after a every dive and he gave me really detailed tips and by the end of the second dive I started to actually feel quite confident. We did two more dives the next day and I felt really good by the end of the trip!

diving,"Hey everyone. Here's the email I just sent to PADI QA. I know very few people who dive, so I wanted to get a few opinions on case I'm in the wrong here.

Hello,

I would like to share with you a less than satisfactory experience I've had with the PADI dive center X. CC'ing the school for transparency.

Over the last few months, I started diving and completed my PADI OpenWater and PADI Advanced certifications at X. Having nothing to compare the school to, I was fairly happy until recently, when I started my wreck diving specialty at the same dive center. We went on two dives to the Jasmin wreck, near X. I didn't enjoy the dives very much and didn't feel as if I had learned anything, as they consisted of simply swimming around the wreck and finding my way back to the anchor line.This week, partially because I was unhappy with my last two dives, and also because X had no space available on their boat, I decided to continue my wreck specialty at another dive center. X provided me with a referral form that (falsely) claims that I have completed the knowledge review and the skills of the first two wreck dives, even though I never did a knowledge review and didn't do any skills aside from some basic navigation around the wreck. Despite that, the second dive center also informed me that I need to buy a ""wreck diving manual"", which is a book that X was supposed to give me. When I asked them if I can come by and pick the book up, they said that they don't have it and can't buy it before Sunday, because today is still a public holiday in X.At that point, having realized that multiple PADI requirements were violated, and that they had essentially charged me for a book they never gave me, I asked for a refund, which they refused to provide. To summarize:

* **X failed to provide me with the wreck diving manual** as part of my wreck diving course. Had I finished the course there, they also wouldn't have provided me with a manual since the shops would only reopen after I got my certification.
* **X didn't teach any theory at all** for the wreck diving course and I never completed a knowledge review, even though the instructor claimed that I did in a referral form. In fact, the instructor did not brief me at all about wreck diving or that specific wreck, and it was very difficult for me to figure out what he expected me to do once underwater.
* **X didn't teach the skills specified¬†by PADI for the first two wreck dives**, even though the instructor signed my logbook and referral forms.
* When I presented the above points to them, the instructor got very defensive and said that I'm not a dive-master or instructor, so I can't question his compliance with PADI standards. He tried to argue that we did complete all the skills of the two wreck dives, and showed me a PDF listing the skills taught in the dives.To give an example:The PDF said something along the lines of: ""\*the student must map the wreck (\****or*** *parts of it)*"". My instructor tried to make the argument that we don't actually have to map the wreck because it says ""***or***"". This made me think that he either thinks I can't read English and I'm a complete fool, or that he actually doesn't understand this simple sentence.
* The instructor then said that he will give me my refund ""tomorrow"" (which I really doubt), and that I should give him my logbook so that he can delete his signature, which of course I refused to do because logbooks are meant to be append-only.¬†

Overall, this process made me feel as if I'm being taken advantage of, by paying to let me swim around a wreck a little bit and then getting a piece of paper for my money. I was very disappointed, as I really wanted to learn wreck diving and I hope that this is not representative of X and diving schools in general.",Complained to PADI about my dive center.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Can we summarize that AOW is basically 5 Speciality courses bundled together, with two of them being mandatory, or am I missing something ?
2. The standalone ""Deep Diver"" speciality course says it ""enables"" you to go as deep as 40m but the AOW documentation says 30m, even though the deep diver ""speciality"" is supposed to be included, what gives ? ^(I want to say it's no a goal of mine to go as deep as possible as a newbie, I just like to know what I'll learn and be paying for.)
3. Are there specialization that are known to not be feasible or not recommended to be bundled in an AOW course ? For example, most of the online information I came across says a Night Diver speciality takes 2 to 3 days, surely the training will be less thorough if taken as part of the AOW course right ?
4. Follow-up on point 3 : I was thinking on top of Deep and Navigation to take Buoyancy ^((i feel my trim could be better)) and Nitrox, then I want to start doing ""confined space"" dives and I don't know if Wreck or Cavern is better, I feel they're very similar and mostly depends on the availability of one or the other in the area you're at ?

PADI AOW-certified diver gets roped into being an instructor for a group of newbies and fails to notice a forming panic attack.

# Long version

I'm a PADI AOW diver, doing my NAUI Master course in June-July. This week, I went off with my company to Krapanj, Croatia, where we went diving. There were three certified divers (one former instructor and divemaster) and five complete newbies in the group, with the certified divers taking one dive first, before the newbies were suited up and given a (very short, based on their account) briefing on the ship.

Afterwards, while the discovery divers were suiting up, the divemaster asked the three of us if we want to go another round, and I said yes, while the two others, including the instructor passed, so I got a new cylinder and the suddenly, I was told to pick a person, take them in the water, and take them around. In a completely unfamiliar area, I might add.

The person I chose, a close friend of mine, had trouble equalizing, so we had to ascend often, and at one point, she failed to inflate her BCD, and was bobbing in the water gasping for air with the regulator out of her mouth. I held her above the water, trying to calm her down, but did not think to inflate her BC either until I heard my ex-instructor colleague shout (for what he said was the seventh time) to do it.

It ended fine, my friend enjoyed the dive even despite this incident, but I was left with mixed feelings.

&amp;#x200B;

What do you guys think, who is at fault for this? Should I have noticed the forming panic attack before it came to head? Should the divemaster have allowed me to act as an instructor in the first place, not being certified as one?",Inappropriate divemaster conduct?

diving,"A short while ago, I was scuba diving in a murky lake (about 12m deep). The visibility was 3-5ft at the bottom and the only wildlife around were pikes and little insect larvae.

We were doing a navigation task at a team and my buddy refused to navigate due to not being comfortable with it. I was happy to do it. My task was to use the compass to navigate a short distance across the lake, then come back. His only task was to keep an eye on our buoyancy.

As you know, you're not supposed to hold on to each other. But he held on to my tank. On the way out there, we ended up surfacing due to him adding air to sort out his buoyancy but not checking our levels. So we had to go back down. No biggie. We descended and got ready to go again. We decided that this was enough distance and I went to alter the compass for the new direction.

My buddy then decided that he wanted to see the compass on my wrist too. Didn't tell me. No nudges l, pokes or signals. He let most of the air out of his BCD to come down to have a look. He let far too much out as he did a big single burst. He swam over my shoulder. As a result, he ended up squashing me as he was far too heavy (he was over 6ft, not a small build and I'm 5'5ft). We sank rapidly towards the bottom of the lake.

I tried to get to the surface because I felt my ears screaming due to the quick pressure change. In his panic, he held on to me. We hit the bottom of the lake. Dropped about 4-5 meters in a few seconds. My ear went BANG. We did eventually get to the surface. I'm currently on strong antibiotics for my ear. 

TLDR: diving buddy squashes me during a navigation task in the lake and causes my ear to perforate.

Has anyone else had this experience? Or one with buddy gone wrong? 

I'm due to fly in 2 weeks (9 1/2 hour flight) for a family holiday and I was told having a perforated ear actually causes less discomfort on a plane.

diving,"I did my open water course in January, in a place with cold-ish water (around 18C), lots of wildlife and good visibility. 

I decided to try diving again this week, in my Mediterranean travel destination. I didn‚Äôt feel confident to go straight to diving, so I had a refresher in the morning before going diving in the afternoon.

We had me, another diver more experienced but still pretty much a beginner, two dive masters and one almost dive master (late stages of training). 


It was quite a pretty wall dive that started shallow, we went to 17m and then slowly worked our way up. We didn‚Äôt need to have a stop at 5 because we would spend most of the later part of the dive between 7 and 4 meters, ascending slowly. 

I was doing great for most of it, keeping my buoyancy ok and not breathing too much out of anxiety. The other beginner diver who was my buddy almost never looked at me to check me out, and had buoyancy problems all the time, and required help from the 3 others frequently. 

Anyway, we are almost wrapping up, the dive, we are at 4 m deep and I already see the boat, when suddenly I see myself squeezed in a weird position close to the wall and my buoyancy goes haywire... I can‚Äôt stop myself from floating up, I do everything in the book to stop it but when I see I‚Äôm at the surface. Awesome :/. 

We are close to the boat, and I assumed maybe we could just finish the dive there... but my new dive buddy (who is now the dive master in training, we switched in the middle of the dive) insists that I have to return underwater to follow the rest of the group. 

So she helps me down a bit too fast, I can‚Äôt equalize... suddenly about 3 meters down my left ear ‚Äúpops‚Äù and I instantly start feeling dizzy. I have fainted before, and that is exactly how it feels. I try to warn my buddy that I‚Äôm not feeling well, point to my ear, and say I need to go up. She says no, I repeat that I really need to, and just start swimming up. I barely make it out of the water, and I don‚Äôt even know who inflated my vest for me. I come back to it, and have a panic attack. I mean, feeling that I was fainting while under water was probably the scariest feeling I‚Äôve ever felt. Never had a panic attack before, so great now I know how that feels too. 

So I spent the rest of the day (that was yesterday) feeling like shit with a lot of pain in my ear and a yellow/red fluid leaking out of it. Today I went to the doctor, who confirmed I punctured my eardrum, and gave me antibiotics. I am flying home tomorrow and will see my doctor there. 

What happened to my ear is not such a big deal, it will heal and soon I‚Äôll be swimming and diving again. I‚Äôm just feeling like shit, because I feel like my inability to do things right ruined the dive for everybody else, and I feel like I put the people who were with me in danger. I love diving, but if I am so bad at this to the point of screwing up what was supposed to be an easy dive so bad, maybe there is no future for me there. I also feel so embarrassed, I never had a panic attack before and I just feel like a freaking drama queen. I don‚Äôt know, I need some perspective. Maybe this is really not for me :(","My first dive after getting an open water certification was a bit of a shitshow. I need some perspective, I guess."

diving,"Hi guys,

I'm trying to figure out my diving plans related to certifications, and am not sure about a few things. I know that SSI and PADI certifications are recognized everywhere for both parties, to a certain level. Currently I have my SSI Open Water &amp; Advanced and have plans to do my Divemaster (and in a further future instructor) at SSI.

I'm leaving for a next diving trip to the Philippines (Palawan area, tips appreciated!) soon, and realized I can almost solely find PADI schools there, at least online. I would be very grateful if someone could clarify the following for me:

&amp;#x200B;

1. If I would now get PADI certifications in for example Nitrox &amp; Deep dive, would this affect my path to SSI dive instructor in any way? 
2. In my scenario, if I would have to choose between PADI Nitrox&amp;DD vs a SSI Nitrox&amp;DD where the PADI one is cheaper, is there any reason it would still be logical to choose for SSI for my future diving plans?

I am usually one of the first people on a dive to use up my air... and I fear it's because I take very shallow breaths. I do this for what I thought was a good reason: I usually keep my lungs half full of air for buoyancy control. If I exhale completely I sink (which I THOUGHT the ""right"" way to breathe). 

&amp;#x200B;

I have since read that divers are supposed to exhale fully and take deep full breaths. You use less air and offload more carbon dioxide that way. If this is correct then how do divers also use their breath to control their buoyancy?  I feel like I am missing something really fundamental.

diving,"Snorkels with purge valves at the bottom, below the mouthpiece, are very common.

Snorkels with ""float"" valves at the top are also very common, to prevent water from entering when diving down.  AKA dry snorkels.

But I've never seen a snorkel with an additional one-way valve inside that forces your exhalation out the bottom instead of out the top.

There are ""two tube"" snorkels around that do this:

https://www.powerbreather.com/en/

And full-face masks seem to do it as well (either with two tubes at the top, or forcing your exhalations out the bottom).

But that's all really complicated, compared to two one-way valves around the mouthpiece itself, one directing inhalations through the tube, and the other directing exhalations out through the bottom.  Or, for simplicity of design, the other one-way valve could be at the top of the snorkel, only letting air in up there, instead of out (there would be more ""mixing"" of the dead air during exhalation, but not too much).

The only down-side to exhalations going out the bottom seems to be bubbles and noise... it would make snorkeling less peaceful.  But scuba divers deal with bubbles from the regulator, an it's not so bad (they flow up the sides of the face, and not in front of the mask).

Am I missing something here?",Why don't snorkels employ two one-way valves to avoid re-breathing CO2?

diving,"Yesterday I was doing some volunteer work for a local organization restoring reefs. I was freediving at like 8ft. Easy peazy right?  


Well, I was using a spare mask I had in a closet (not my usual dive mask which I currently have in a locker off site), it kind of hurt/ put pressure at the top of my nose (where it meets between the eyes). Just after helping out I went home and blew my nose and it was bloody. I cleared my sinuses after a few blows and it was ok for the rest of the evening. But I woke up this morning and I had bloody phlegm. I took it to mean that the bloody mucus just trickled downward over night. It is now noon and I still have spotty red chunky phlegm and mucus. I will admit that I was shooting up to the service fast yesterday. I'm not used to freediving and my lungs need practice. I am out of air in like 12 seconds underwater doing the light work I was doing so I'd come up fast b/c I was out of breath.  


Assuming this is sinus squeeze. This has never happened to me before scuba diving. I have no issues equalizing on long dives when on compressed air. I was supposed to go out (scuba) diving this morning but I'm going to wait several more days before doing so.  


Any advice on how I can help speed up the healing process? The area at the top of my nose feels sore when I touch it. Maybe it's just a burst capillary from an ill-fitting mask and gravity is bringing it down the back of my throat? IDK, I feel fine otherwise but I'll avoid submerging my face in pool or salt water to avoid infection.

I'll start by saying that I've never dived or snorkeled at all, before but have a very keep interest.

I've started to look up and research different things and figured I would come pop my head in and look around - I've heard wonderful things about the Diving communities that are around. 

I've set myself a longterm goal of diving in Australia, Ideally with Sharks - this has been a 'bucket list' thing for me for as long as I can remember and the sheer thought of actually doing it has really turned my mood around. 

I'm not going to lie - I'm not a powerful swimmer, I can swim but it has been a long time and my fitness has slipped a lot since then. So my first port of call is to get back to the gym and start hitting the pool. 

While I'm doing that I've come here to adk your opinions on Diving lessons/being PADI registered. I live in the UK, and have a Go Dive! Close which offers PADI courses. Is this something I should pursue once I feel physically up to it, or should I look at other lessons first?

One main draw is the community - I really like the sound of the Social Diving groups- so if anyone is in/around Derby then I would love to chat about this stuff, maybe make a new friend?

I got my PADI OW certification 3 weeks ago in the Perhentian Islands (plug Angel Divers) and just completed my AOW in Cebu (plug Cebu Dive Centre). I love diving and getting to see everything under the sea and was able to complete my certifications, but I can't seem to get over the anxiety I have before going underwater and while under the water. It's okay because I can still dive and enjoy it, but it SEVERELY impacts my air consumption. The past few dives I'd have to share air with a buddy during the safety stop and most of my fellow divers were coming up with 100 PSI or so. I know it's because I can't control my breathing because my instructor said for every one breath he took I would take about three. I'd have coffee and sometime take prescribed medication (ADHD) before dives and am wondering if anyone else has experience with stimulant medications and how that affects their air consumption. I'm fairly confident that my medication gives me some anxiety and that it is exacerbated when under the water. I constantly feel that my air consumption will deplete and I will die or something else bad will happen and I will die, ironically causing me to consume more air and breathe faster. It's not so much the skills that cause me to breathe rapidly as it is the whole concept of being underwater and not being able to breathe through my nose/having to focus on breathing and worrying about forgetting to breathe or not being able to breathe. I have tried to control my breaths with limited success, I can breathe deeply for a bit but end up feeling like I'm not getting enough air and end up taking a large amount of rapid breaths to feel better.

Just wondering if anyone else has experienced this diver's anxiety and what they did to help combat it and relax underwater. I've heard yoga and meditation, but wondering if maybe I just need to pop some anti-anxiety meds or maybe lay off the stimulants &amp; coffee.

diving,"Hi guys and gals,

&amp;#x200B;

I've had some searches trying to find anything like this but am struggling, so feel free to point me in the right direction. There has been a lot of articles about how full-faced snorkelling masks are unsafe, and how you cannot equalize using them, and that they are basically POS...

&amp;#x200B;

I can't seem to find anywhere that compares or even explains what makes a full-faced SCUBA Mask or a Commercial Diving Mask any better? I understand that the dead zone is minimised by having a skirt around the mouth and nose in a commercial mask, and that there is a block to push your nose against to equalize in a helmet, but that is about all I have found.

&amp;#x200B;

So, if you have any pictures of the inside of full-faced Scuba or Commercial masks that you can send to me so I can have a look and understand them that would be super-helpful!

&amp;#x200B;

With that in mind, I am also wondering about a little project to turn a full-face scuba mask into a useable free-diving mask by applying the same things that you would find in a commercial/full-faced mask. I assume it is simply a matter of it being a niche that isn't profitable, or else they would be on the market? Or is the engineering side of it quite a challenge...",Full Face Diving/Commercial Mask compared to Snorkelling Masks? Need help and pictures if you can provide!

diving,"I dove the pit about 8 years ago and knew I wanted to start cave diving the second I hit the first passage. Looking back it was a dive far beyond my experience but I was young, and most importantly lucky (the guide was training an apprentice and both had double back mounts, I was 15 and between them with a single 80cf, all bad practice, dove with the guide 3x a day for a week before and he offered the dive to me, wasnt going to say no)

Started diving about 15 years ago, didnt take advantage of opportunities I had during those years but have about 200 dives, finally getting my master cert, then starting the sidemount course to move to tech, then tectrimix, cavern... ect. Still a long way out from where I want to be, but working with what I have until I have the opportunity to go further.

Naturally sidemount is a discipline to have, the instructor I've been working with normally dives sidemount but I'd like to get a jump on the course before I start. He didnt have a extra harness for the course (also not available to rent where I am that I found) and modifying my travel BCD gave me a bad vibe, so wanting to work into tech then cavern I decided on the razor system. Looked at the Hollis 100, stealth, razor, OMS and nomad. Not entirely sure I made the right choice but I got it second hand for about half off. I set the harness up after watching a ton of YouTube videos (and the manual... I started with that, the webbing is still stupid stiff). However, the harness doesnt feel right where my D rings are and the idea of using bungees is strange to me, so.. any advice would be appreciated.

As for why I only have my travel rig, packing was an issue because I travel for long work stints and diving is an rare bonus, it's an oceanic jetpack (listen, drunk me isnt allowed on Amazon anymore... but it is pretty awesome as a carry on, that's about all I have to say for it)","working on my sidemount course, any advice would be appreciated!

diving,"Hi there, 

I would like some opinions. I have wanted to dive since childhood, but now I have the financial means for it, I am nervous.

I like swimming, and took a life guard course half a year ago. I was never able to get to dive up the doll at the bottom of the pool at 3,75 meters (if I remember correctly), due to pain in my ears. (I got tips to clear my ears, but didn't manage to do it). I tried to ignore the pain once, and got a painful ear infection the day after.
Now when I swim, I feel pressure at my ears already at a shallow level of 1-2 m or so. It seems worse than before, but maybe it is because I pay more attention to it?
My regular doctor says my ears are fine and says it's okay to start diving.
As a kid I once had an ear perforation because of swimming to the bottom of the pool. I don't remember anything of the event itself, so I don't think I felt the pressure in my ears as I do now. Or I just ignored it back then.

So now I want to start diving, but I am nervous that my ears won't handle it well. I don't see myself having much fun with this hobby if I were to deal with painful ears all the time. Is this something that will get better with training, or should I consider these 'signs' to try some other hobby instead ?

Thanks",Nervous to try diving because of painful ears

diving,"I don't know if this really belongs here but I just had such a strange experience I feel like I need to get it down.

Basically, this past weekend my boyfriend and I went scuba diving at a center in a remote part of coastal Africa (I don't want to name names, but if you know, you know). In late 2018, a client who at this center ""disappeared"" during a shallow, day dive, and they only found her body a week later when it washed up on a beach 30 km away.

The reason for how she could disappear in good conditions (good vis, mild current) was never actually made public, so everyone kind of figured she had a heart attack or purposely swam away and just got lost and panicked, something like that. 

Anyway - this weekend I visited the center for the first time to do two dives. It was the strangest diving I've ever done. First the center itself was very dingy - the tractor to push the boat to the beach broke down, they gave me three empty cylinders before finding a full one - and they gave no briefing whatsoever for the first dive.  Oh, and they didn't ask to see either mine or my boyfriend's certification ever.

But then a few minutes we got to the bottom of the dive site, we realized a client and the dive master were gone.

They had swam in the opposite direction of us, and it took about 15 minutes for us to find them again. We continued the dive after they were found, only for the dive master to go off on his own again.

The second dive I did with them was the first time I ever panicked underwater.

I reached 50 bar about 50 minutes into the dive, so I notified the dive master. He gave the OK sign, then continued to swim. I waited a few minutes, thinking maybe he was looking for something, but no, he was just continuing to look for fish. So I turned to another person who works at the center and notified her that I had 40 bar. She gave the OK. Nothing happened. We keep swimming. I start to panic a bit because now I'm at 30 bar and the dive master nor anyone else seems to have any interest in surfacing (we were at 21m). Finally, at 20 fucking bar, I shake the dive master, point up, and start going up on my own. Finally he follows. 

I'm still a fairly new diver so maybe I'm overreacting. But for a dive center that had a client die under strange circumstances, these people seem to have very, very little interest in following a strict regiment. I'd be interested to hear other divers' opinions. Maybe this happens other places more often than I think, so I'd be interested to know.
