We're visiting several different communities on reddit and elsewhere in search of two things:

1. Organizations making an immediate impact to preserve the biosphere and reduce atmospheric carbon that are in need of funding right now.

2. Forests, waterways and other wildlife habitats that are currently available for sale and in danger of being bought by commercial entities such as logging, mining, drilling and development companies. 

Links to existing lists and organizational hubs are also welcome. We want to find ongoing and especially time-sensitive causes that are in immediate need of funding. We're looking to be as comprehensive as possible, so every suggestion is sincerely appreciated!",0.026,0.85,0.124,0.8908

\-the planet begins to warm from greenhouse gases

\-this warms the oceans, and melts the ice

\-this alters the currents in the ocean which mix oxygen into deeper waters

\-the oceans begin to lose oxygen, species begin to die

\-methane/sulfur bacteria from the ocean floor begin to bloom in the low-oxygen water

\-kills off ocean life, emits poison hydrogen sulfide gas into atmosphere

\-life on land is poisoned/suffocated

&amp;#x200B;

Other factors that contribute to this cycle:

\-volcanic eruptions heat the planet and add sulfur to air

\-passing comets add toxic dust into atmosphere/ocean - helping the bacterial blooms

\-the magnetic poles shift, creating a temporarily weaker magnetic field on Earth, letting in harmful UV rays

\-solar flare or micronova

&amp;#x200B;

Seems like we are well into the cycle. So not good news for life that needs oxygen.

We have already fully developed the software but to ensure our project continues and makes a change, we need **YOUR** help. I would like to ask you to vote for us either on the take action page of our website ( [http://aquation.ml/help/](http://aquation.ml/help/) ) and/or on the official voting page ([https://app.moonshotpirates.com/bootcamps/previews/srZ7X8Z8oIVU0FsG/voting/Jd7KlVZIdGEz2mh8](https://app.moonshotpirates.com/bootcamps/previews/srZ7X8Z8oIVU0FsG/voting/Jd7KlVZIdGEz2mh8)).

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ASWAP (Autonomous Sub-aquatic Waste Acquiring and Pre-processing) unit:

It is well known that underwater waste has a **massive destructive** effect on life **above and below** water.

Not only does it directly **harm and kill** living organisms underwater but it also influences the rest of the ecosystem by reducing the ocean plants (which contribute 50-85% of the O2 production on earth) level by approximately **40% since the 80s**.

The ASWAP unit can collect underwater waste and sort them **automatically** using a weakly supervised waste detection model and a waste classification model.

By sending a drone underwater to collect waste, we are removing the need of a trained worker who would ordinarily have to face the **dangers of the depths** to accomplish the same tasks.

One of the greatest issues faced in the ocean cleanup projects today is the **handling of waste** after it is collected. We use **advanced** classification models (92+% accuracy) to sort garbage in our docking stations so that it can be recycled and resold.

Our solution can **safely and efficiently** remove waste debris from underwater areas which may be less accessible to humans, and thus protect the ecosystem.

&amp;#x200B;

1,100,4108,"Looking for marine field experience, in the US, that pays well? Become a Protected Species Observer! Hi everyone, I work as a protected species observer (PSO) and the company I contract for is looking to recruit more observers for upcoming projects.

Whats a PSO? When a company wants to do a marine geological survey of any kind, be it oil, windmills, or construction, they are required to have PSO onboard to watch out for Marine Mammals, Sea turtles, and other protected species to mitigate any potential damage the survey equipment can cause.

What do I need to be a PSO? Theres a few certifications that are required, as well as your own gear. After you have gotten everything certified you will probably be $2000 in the hole, however you easily earn this amout back after your first month. The nice thing is if you file your taxes you can write off most of the expenses on your taxes. I can earn a sign up bonus for everyone I recruit so to prevent people from just reading this post and going through the certification themselves, I wont list everything, gotta look out for #1.

Whats a day in the life of a PSO like? Im currently working on a video about this very thing. You pretty much stare at the ocean on a boat, miles from land until you spot a protected species. Then after figuring out if the animal is close enough to be potentially affected by the survey equipment you get to shut down the boats operations. There are incredibly boring days, and there are incredible days where youll see 12 Humpback whales feeding in an upwelling next to the boat, or a group of 70 dolphins follow the boat for hours. We also see tons of other wildlife, sharks, birds, turtles, ect. You have to fill out paper work on the protected species but thats pretty much the hardest thing you have to do. I listen to podcasts, music, and audio books while I am on watch, so you can be some what productive. The Starting pay for PSOs is a day rate and is typically 150-200 a day, but I have been doing this for a year already and have made more than 300$ a day on some projects.

A typical schedule is not something I have had in my exeperience as a PSO. Some PSOs work a constant 5 week on, 5 week off shift. This has not been my experience. Im currently on a project expected to last 2 months, Ive also been projects as short as 11 days. But I also follow the money, whereever the highest pay is, is usually where I am, but some people might prefer a lower day rate in exchange for a more consistent schedule. Thats gonna be more your call.

Whats life like offshore? Mostly what you make of it. I work about 13 hours a day, and out of that time I am on watch for 7-8 hours. the rest of my time, I finish paper work. I also work on scripts for my youtube channel, edit photographs of animals I have seen, work out, eat, watch movies.

What are some disqualifying things for working offshore? The internet is pretty shit offshore, just enough to send emails, and texts, so if you need daily internet this job isnt for you. Honestly though, its wonderful to unplug for a few weeks at a time. Also if you experience motion/sea sickness easily, however most people adapt after a few days. You also need to pass a drug test, which is a huge bummer when you work out of states that are recreationally legal (looking at you Massachusetts). Medical marijuana is still disqualifying, theres no exceptions, they will straight up call a helicopter to pick you up if you fail an on vessel drug test.

Some perks. You get paid to watch wildlife. You get paid pretty well. You can log your sea days for a captains license. International work on all seven continents and all five oceans is a availible (You'll have to be competitive for them however). You can get certifications in Passive acoustic monitoring (Opens up more international work, and higher pay.)

TL;DR: Get paid to watch marine life.

If this sounds like something you want more info on as a career, feel free to comment here, or DM me. Im in port until Tuesday so Ill answer what I can. Ill be offshore on a project for a few weeks and ill answer more when we return to port. You can also check out my instagram for pictures of wildlife i've seen offshore @ Barefoot\_zak.",0.055,0.85,0.095,0.9753

Save Our Seas Saturdays are asking you and your group/org to participate in our first ever Global SOS on June 6th, just before World Oceans Day. Normally we would go to our nearest beach or river every Saturday to pick litter and share a photo online but we have moved to taking action digitally due to the pandemic. We are demanding systemic change from governments and corporations to protect our oceans from threats like climate change, plastic pollution and more. Our first ever Global SOS on June 6th will be part of our week of digital action that we‚Äôre currently planning. You can get involved by following us on social media @SosSaturdays and on June 6th, take a photo of yourself with a sign about the oceans and share it on your social media, similar to Climate Strike Online. Don‚Äôt forget to use #SOSSaturdays too! If you want to help us plan this incredible day of digital action or help coordinate SOS Saturdays in general, please sign up on this website (https://www.saveourseasglobal.org/) to join our workspace.

Got a couple questions which Id like to have an answer for. I have tried doing a google search but I see to be going in circles. 

&amp;#x200B;

How can i find the border to an ocean such as the Atlantic Ocean? Where does the Pacific edge end?  It started with a caption of my friends saying they are swimming in the Atlantic while living in PEI. I believe that its actually the Gulf of St.Lawrence which made me wonder if , me living on the west coast ,have I ever swam in the actual Pacific? Or was it a strait or gulf or whatever else.

I run a scuba diving/freediving blog, and I have been doing a Q&amp;A with people who are in the diving industry; eg. an UW photographer, a commercial diver, and others. And have a few up-coming interviews with a freediving champion and scuba diving course directors.

I am interested in doing a Q&amp;A with a working marine biologist or coral researcher. Questions would be about your daily work life, coolest/weirdest things you have seen, how to get into the industry, etc.

Please let me know if you would like to be interviewed. I would send you a list of questions to answer, and you will need to provide 2-3 photos of you or your job.

1,62,2124,"How would you classify the different threats to biodiversity ? Hello,

I am making a detailed **list of environmental threats**; but before making it ""official"", I would like to know your opinion about the ***main*** **and** ***sub*** **categories** of those threats. I am taking marine life example.

For now, here is my classification :

* **Pollution :** Pure Unwanted/**Collateral**  effects of human activities. This include sub-classes of pollution,  maybe chemical (the most common), physical (nets), biological  (algae?),or even energetic (light, sound, radioactivity, heat ?)
* **Poaching :** Targeting **specific** species to gain money by selling it, dead or alive. Poaching can also create collateral effects on other species.
* **Over-fishing :** Targeting edible species, but in a **gluttonous**   way, without any care, making the resources slowly wither away. This   often create collateral effects on other species AND environment, like  the nets **scraping** the coral reef. Or the **electro** fishing...
* **Bad reputation** : Targeting species just to **wipe them** out of the globe, because they have a bad reputation of human/cattle killer The best example is the Great White Shark.
* **Ethic problems :** Ways of treating species without any care for their **suffering**. This include dolphin shows, or seafood eaten alive.
* **Environment conquest :** Targeting the environment to transform it or use it in another way. This include **deforestation** to grow crops, for example. Or even some **mangrove fish farming.**
* **Global warming effects :** All the direct **consequences** of global warming. I do not know if it deserve a category tough, since global warming is caused by CO2/CH4/other **gases pollution**, but there is so **many effects** that it may have it is **own category**.

I do not know where to put **collision** with animals (manatee), and general **stress** due to the sole human presence.  
And maybe add somewhere **genetic** pollution, and **invasive** species. However IDK if it is a **main** category or a **sub** category.

What do you think ? Do you have any proposition for ***main*** classes AND ***sub***\-classes of environmental threats ?",0.109,0.771,0.12,0.5149

I study Physics (and Chemistry). I have to do a very important project with pretty strict conditions. The theme is ""Oceans"". Unfortunately I am not familiar with it and struggle to find an idea.   


&amp;#x200B;

Here are the conditions for the thing to be relevant for such a project :  


\- I *have* to be able to do **experiments** (for instance, a friend is studying the heat regulation system of whales, and thus is mesuring the thermic diffusion through whale skin and whale fat)  


\- It cannot be related to biology (so nothing related to hormones or proteins production, digestive systems, etc.) 

  
\- Morphology-related phonomenons, such as the punch of the shrimp mantis, *are* *welcome*, because they can be interpreted strictly from a physicist is point of view.  


&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for reading. I hope you will be able to help me !!! Anything can help !

0,52,1074,"Do you get proper primary and secondary dive lights? Primary light is the one you generally use, and if the primary light fails during a dive, you switch to a backup light. What are the differences between them? 

The primary dive lights should be:

* They are robust and powerful.
* They have long burn times.
* They are higher in power, and brighter for deeper uses.

The secondary dive lights usually are:

* They are more compact, smaller and lighter in weight.
* They have shorter burn times.
* They are typically less powerful, but sufficient enough to serve as a backup.

Carrying a backup light on your dive is a good idea. You never know when your primary dive light will die out, or if you are going on longer dives, it‚Äôs always worthwhile to have a secondary dive light with you for those deeper, darker depths you plan going through. For example, you can take [D26 1600](https://www.xtar.cc/product/XTAR-D26-1600-Diving-Flashlight-43.html) as your primary dive light and [D20 1000](https://www.xtar.cc/product/XTAR-D20-1000-Diving-Flashlight-143.html) as your secondary light.

I am not sure if this is the right place for this, but I have got some questions and I felt like subreddits about diving would be able to give me the answers I seek. So lets dive into it.

\- What got you into (scuba) diving?  
\- What do you enjoy about (scuba) diving?  
\- Do you think (scuba) diving is useful (in this context =&gt; any reason besides it being fun or enjoyable)?  
\- Do you think everyone should (learn how to) dive?  

If you could answer even just 1 of these, I would greatly appreciate it. I am curious to see what people have to say.

Thank you for your time, and have a nice day.

But do you know your backup dive light can also do it? With proper position and composition, you can shot unique images without the extra cost of a strobe. 

Why? As you know, the Macro shooting is shot the macro subjects up close. Only a single point of light is needed to illuminate the macro creatures and make them show their original colors. That is enough. In that case, a dive torch with narrow beams can do it.

Using this dive torch to create a spotlight, you can actually see the beam range before shooting a picture. ¬†

Bright your dive light around the side of the subject, rather than head-on. It can create the slide lighting. It could accentuate textures and make the image a bit moodier. Handy dive light works well especially for subjects in the sand such as stargazer and seahorses, which aren‚Äôt too skittish to move if you place a dive torch close by. 

Dive torches can also be used to backlight for sedentary subjects. If the subject doesn‚Äôt move at all, then you can simply rest the torch in the sand or an empty spot. However, if the subject is swimming or in the water column, then you‚Äôll need another diver to hold the light.

0,45,2330,"18lbs or 30lbs -- enough lift? Dive Gear Help Hello fellow Redditors,

I am newbie so pardon my ignorance - I am getting my certificate later this month. I live in South Florida and my best friend, who is an avid diver, is getting married late Spring 2021. He is been trying to get me into diving for years but between work, travel, baby, money... it took a push. The push came in the form of a diving trip bachelor party for 7 days and an expected 25+ dives. I am jumping in head first - I want to buy some equipment and get taught in that equipment. The bachelor party diving will be happening(covid willing) in St. Lucia or the like in Feb/March 2021.

Here is where I need help. I have done extensive research and have narrowed down two different setups for BCD but I am stuck between the two. If you have made it this far and you area an experienced diver - maybe you can help - and thank you in advance if you can.

I like the simple approach of wing, backplate and harness. I have no interest in a jacket style BCD. I will almost exclusively be diving the Caribbean or south Florida for the foreseeable future. I am 5'11"" and 190lbs and a strong swimmer (do not know if any of that is relevant)

**Q: Do I get the Apeks One piece harness WITH the SS Apeks backplate +Apeks WTX D30 wing or WITH aluminum Apeks backplate + Apeks WTX D18 wing?**

I plan on using a standard weight belt that I use for lobstering/pole fishing for lead. I have 16lbs in 2lbs increments and a standard rubber belt. I do not know how many pounds I will need yet to be zero buoyant. I will be using neoprene tech shorts for storage. Again - do not know if any of this helps.

I will be traveling with it but the weight difference of 5lbs does not seem to make a difference between alum and SS in the backplate. I would simply use the SS as more weight requiring less for my belt. I chose those combinations thinking that would be the most efficient combo --- I could be wrong and correct me if I am not. If I missed the mark entirely - please provide constructive criticism and tell me what I should get. :- )

Side note: I am leaning towards the aluminum backplate and 18lb wing as my wife (5'5"" and 130 lbs) could potentially use it if it is not enough lift for me so potentially no harm - no foul.

The app not only deals in dive sites now, but includes a directory of dive centers as well - if you are an operator, or you have had a *particularly* good experience somewhere, consider adding an entry for the center, so that more people travelling in the area can see it!

If you have any feedback or comments on the application, suggestions, gripes, praise or grumbling, drop by to our [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/dive.site.overwatch), and leave me a note - all comments are welcome, and will be responded to!

I am about to buy a diving computer as I plan to get more serious about diving (currently at advanced level, 25 dives).

Initially I wanted to buy the Cressi Giotto diving computer (many recommendations, bit better than his little brother the Leonardo model and quite affordable).

Now, I stumpled upon Suunto is D5 during some research. I was immedialy stunned by its modern yet simplistic information interface. I do not know if you relate you it, but I find some diving computer displays a bit tricky to read.. it is seems a little crammed sometimes. The Suunto clearly has more modern featuers and looks. However, it is also double in price.

My question is, do you think it is worth investing in the Suunto D5 model? If you have experience with it, what are your thoughts and would you recommend it? Is it worth double the price of the Cressi Giotto?

Hoping someone may have gone through something similar and can show me the light. I should also note I am not particularly new to diving; I have roughly 80 dives under my belt without issues.

Back in December, I was on a dive with a lot of surge bringing me up and down and my ear started to not feel right. According to DAN resources, all signs pointed to a middle ear barotrauma. As I was not in my home state (yay US health care!), I couldn‚Äôt afford to see an out of network MD until I got home. Between work, COVID, required referrals in the US, and appts being booked months away, it took A WHILE to finally get seen by an ENT (today‚Ä¶). 

Back in December, on my flight home, I had SEVERE pain in my ear. Thankfully the flight was quick. Since then, the pain has only been a dull ache for the most part but certain things set it off to being more painful like cold/wind/water/loud noises/physically pushing on my ear. Trying to swim in a cold lake recently and my ear was very uncomfortable. I‚Äôve been taking Flonase daily for the last couple months to no avail 

Flash-forward to today. I get a hearing test and the results are normal. I get an ENT to look into my ears and nose and throat and that‚Äôs all normal. He can‚Äôt figure it out. Says I have no fluid, no infection...

I just want to be able to dive again but if it hurts to swim at the surface, I‚Äôm sure down with pressure will be extra painful! Free diving a few feet below the surface HURTS.

Has anyone out there experienced something similar? Did you find out what was wrong/find something that would help? I would like to get a second opinion of another ENT but want to come in with some suggestions!",0.126,0.794,0.08,-0.9581

I recently started the search for a backplate/wing setup. I noticed some companies tend to offer 2 types of straps. The basic type that need to be set up once and kept the same for all dives and the ""deluxe"" versions. Versions that have clips like a regular bcd to offer easyer adjustment and are more targeted towards rec divers.
(example: xdeep zen VS xdeep zen deluxe) 

What are your opinions about those ""deluxe"" versions?
I am a rec diver and often change between a 7mm wetsuit and a 7mm with an extra 7mm on top. Thus I was thinking of getting an adjustable one. However I read on some forums that it is not at all needed even for a change in wetsuit.

Anyway, when I was 15 and I started diving, I found out that that weird thing I did was useful to equalize without hands, and I told my instructor and he told me that very little people can do it, and it is usually related to having a lot of wax in your ears (which I do).

The thing is, I have just catched a couple planes, and I spent the whole flight not equalized until it went down, and the second one was fine until it went down, gosh my ears never hurt so bad. I know 3 ways to equalize, plus my own way, and none were the tiniest bit useful.
(I compare it to diving since it is still pressure changes)

I would like to know more about equalization, why sometimes those methods work and sometimes do not, what to do to avoid this problem and that stuff, because I completely love diving, but now I have fear that the same will happen diving, and that I will not be able to enjoy diving anymore.",0.077,0.809,0.115,0.523

Looking for a little wisdom please.

Background:
So, I am currently based in the UK and dive a handful of times a year when travelling for fun and work (outdoor instructor and expedition leader) 

Thing is, as cash is always tight I either borrow or rely on my dive buddies for computer related info.

However, I am about to move to Dakar and plan on working through my certs over the next year or so (Currently only OW) but would like to equip myself with a computer from a UK based company (cost, warranty, repair etc will be easier this way when I visit the home) that will work for me at my current level but also be suitable on my journey through the certs. (End goal is definitely dive instruction for more international employment oppos)

Have used Suunto Zoops so far and like them, if that helps. 

So yeah, advice please?

(Also, if anyone has any dive tips for Dakar, please let me know too!)

Title pretty much says it all but was really cool.  Going to be editing a video at some point with some footage but about an hour ago the young lady who lost her cell phone had her Aunt come and pick it up from me.  It had been lost around mid April 2019 and I found it yesterday 8/24/20.  Phone was in a plastic case that helped protect it from getting wet but the MicroSD card was not working as I tried to get some info from that first.  Was eventually able to unlock the phone and get the email address for the owner.  About 30 minutes after I contacted her I got a reply and was setup to hand it over.  I know that the young lady had likely already replaced the phone but still with how times are I can imagine it could turn into a little extra cash for her or maybe save not needing a replacement if the phone she is currently using is damaged or of a lesser quality.  

Went down already planning to pull a bunch of trash out of the water and accomplished that pretty well though there was some other stuff I could not possible remove at this point so had to leave it.

0,59,1279,"Diving / Swimming under water in maximal depth of 2 meters. Hello there,

i have a (stupid?) question on diving or underwater swimming in the local swimming pool at a maximal depth of 2, maybe 3 meters.

Short things first I have ear problems on both my ears, but especially on my right one, where the ear drum is deformed and has scars on it, which gives a feeling of permanent ear pressure or.. inflammation or something like that.
Since I really love swimming and diving in low water Situations but kinda cannot because of this reason.

Now my question is: 

Can I go diving / swimming under water with ear plugs, that do not have a membrane for water pressure in it? Or is it too dangerous to do it like that. 
My ear plugs would be made at my hearing aid provider with a perfect fit ear plug for around 80‚Ç¨ made of some sort od silicon or rubber like material.

If not, are there any serious alternatives to that? Ive read about plugs with holes / specific membranes in it that helped a lot of people, but was not sure if it helped in my case.. 

Im sorry for the dumb question, since I think this sub is not particularly the right for my purposes. 
It would be maximum 3 meters of depth. And even if I wanted to do snorling im reefs it would be around the same depth. 
And sorry for my bad english, it is not my Mother language.

Moving to San Diego for grad school for 2 years, already know I want to spend free time snorkeling/learning to freedive. I have $250 to spend on snorkel, fins, and mask. Would rather spend money once than upgrade in in 12 months using student loan money, so I would love for it to be stuff I can grow in to.

Conventional wisdom when buying gear: GO TO A LOCAL SHOP. This is a dope idea, and I would love to support local shops in San Diego, but something tells me mask-try ons are not really a great idea at the moment. Can you all help me out???

Mask-- female, medium size face I guess? Accepting any and all recommendations.

Snorkel-- I have gotten the sense from reading that dry is a bad idea for freediving; what about semi-dry? 

Fins-- Kind of at a loss-- halp! 

Grateful for all shared wisdom, and would welcome recommendations on local shops to patronize once Covid is less prevalent. Thank you!!!",0.046,0.736,0.218,0.9852

He told me he went to DIT Seattle and I looked them up and they are quite expensive for 7 months.  I am just wondering because I have been looking around the internet for quite some time which would be better DIT Seattle or ocean Corp Texas, DIT Seattle seems like it is a great school and has better job placement but it is quite substantially more expensive and it does not provide housing neither does Texas but Texas is $19,000 compared to Seattle which is $30,000 probably offers more too. I know salvage diving is kind of different from scuba diving because the air is surface supplied I am just looking for opinions from professional divers who have a little bit more experience than me any information from you guys would be a great help because I am thinking of going with Texas but I am unsure.

I love to free dive and lobster dive during the season and have been doing so for around 4-5 years now. I used to be able to hit 50ft(15m) every dive pretty easy up until about two years ago, for some reason I began having trouble equalizing and now can max out at 50ft(15m) on my first 1-3 dives and then usually end up diving no deeper than 10-20ft(3-6m) depending on the day. 

My left ear feels totally fine, however my right ear is having problems, when I put my finger just under where my ear starts(just below the earlobe) and where the top of my jaw flexes it feels like theres a tiny pea sized air bubble there and is not there on the left side.

I am wondering if anyone has heard or experienced this themselves as I think it might be the cause to my problems if it is affecting my Eustachian tube. Its been there for about 2 years now(at least thats when I noticed it) and I am wondering what it is.

I have an issue with my eardrum, where it is perforated and will not heal on its own. I can get surgery for it, and I did, only for it to end up undone. My doctor told me that because part of my ear never fully developed, trying to seal it will just cause eardrum to get filled up with wax again, causing me to go back to having tubes again...So there is essentially no point in sealing it.

Now I know getting water in the ears is going to cause all sorts of issues, such as ear infections, imbalance, pain (massive pain), and so on. Is this obstacle something I can get around, or should I give up? I am mainly asking for my curiosity is sake.",0.065,0.917,0.018,-0.8204

Is this a legitimate thing because I find it hard to believe that someone who can hold their breath fine at the beach is suddenly incapable at the springs.

I want to see if I can come up with some kind of solution to a transponder to use for surface or even underwater recording that isnt the $2k+ surface rig that OTS sells.  Its over kill for me at the moment.  As I just want to use it for in-dive commentary and not have to post dub my videos. 

I was thinking a raspberry pi, SDR, lifeproof case type rig with a transponder connected that could work battery operated.   Just not sure if anyone has done something similar or if anyone has even just got a transponder hooked to say a pc on the surface that can pick up and record the audio.

\- Jumping out of helicopters  
\- Searching and recovering drowned victims or items used as evidence  
\- Being on-call 24/7  
\- Diving in low viz, cold, or at altitude

I found it highly fascinating as it is not something that recreational scuba divers really think about. Usually, I am in tropical waters with good visibility, diving for fun. I know I did not know much about this career or job until the interview, and I learned a lot from his answers.

I hope you guys enjoy it! Let me know if there is a diver in another industry who I should interview.

A few weeks back I suffered from a spontaneous collapsed lung while running. Strange, because I am a fit and generally healthy person. Also a CT scan showed pretty normal lungs. Anyways, I am getting chemical pleurodesis to prevent collapses from happening again. My surgeon even offered me, after some begging from my side, the option to do surgery on both sides, so both lungs have smaller chance of collapsing and I get medically cleared to dive and start my initiation course as scuba dive instructor.

0,33,4731,"What gears do you need for diving Diving equipment is the guarantee of diving safety for divers. Good-looking, fashionable and technological are all based on safety, reliability and comfort. Diving equipment can be prepared by yourself or rented on various islands.¬†Now let us take a look at what equipment to prepare for diving. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yljfbd7foc851.png?width=1135&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=93abf5fc47a7c2576a13ba0c88d724ca8fb8cf29

**Diving Mask &amp; Snorkel**

A diving mask (or dive mask/scuba mask) allows you¬†to see the breathtaking surroundings clearly under the water. The three elements of best choice are comfort, good vision, and anti-fogging.¬†The masks should be in good quality and the frame should be suitable for your face shape. 

As for snorkels, not every diver will need one. However, it‚Äôs normally suggested for beginners to carry one, while more experienced divers will see it as optional. This breathing tube comes in handy when you‚Äôre swimming facedown on the surface. In addition, snorkels also help to save the air in your tank.

**Diveskin &amp; Wetsuits**

Diveskin¬†is suitable for wearing in tropical waters. It can be worn on the inside of the wetsuits, which is convenient for taking off the wetsuits and also protecting your skin.

The thickness of wetsuits is between 1-5mm, suitable for the environment with a water temperature of 10-20 degrees. Wetsuits should fit your body (generally tighter is appropriate), provide less positive buoyancy and have good waterproof performance. 

**Fins**

Fins are generally matched with diving boots. They give you control over your movement and allow you to propel yourself through the water with speed and agility. Fins are divided into open heel and full-foot.¬†Within those two categories, it finds two more variants - blade or split.

Open heel fins are commonly used in cold water. Full-foot fins completely cover your feet and are normally used in warmer water. 

**Scuba Tank or** **Diving Cylinder**

A scuba tank or diving cylinder is another vital component of your diving gear. It stores large volumes of air, allowing you to breathe underwater. Most tanks have a maximum pressure rating of around 2000 to 3500 psi. Generally made of steel or aluminum, scuba tanks come in various styles and sizes. You can either rent them or invest in one if you plan to dive frequently.

**Regulator**

The function of the regulator is to convert the high-pressure air in the cylinder into normal-pressure air and then let us breathe. The regulator has the greatest impact on safety in all equipment.¬†It has something called a first stage, which connects to the tank or diving cylinder you wear on your back, and a second stage‚Äîthe part of the regulator that you put in your mouth. It also has a backup second stage and gauges. When choosing a regulator, comfort and performance is what you need first.

**Diving¬†Computer**

It is almost listed in the to-buy list. It is a diversified multifunctional diving instrument that can check the safety stop time, dive depth, times, too fast speed warning, NOFLY time, historical record, etc. If you connect it to some small equipment, you can also check the residual pressure.¬†Renting a dive computer can cost you more money, so it‚Äôs often better to just purchase one.

**BCD**

BCD (buoyancy control device) also called buoyancy compensator. It has three main functions: 

1. allows you to float on the water to rest or swim 

2. allows you to adjust your buoyancy when underwater

3. used as a back frame, carrying the entire scuba system on your body.

It‚Äôs basically a vest or jacket that you wear during your dive to help manage your buoyancy.

**Dive Light**

The diving flashlight can be used for night dive, cave dive¬†and fill light in daily shooting.¬†It also provides critical light when exploring cracks and crevices. Many dive lights have SOS mode, can be used to transmit signals. It is one of the necessary auxiliary tools for divers.

**Depth Gauge, Submersible Pressure Gauge &amp; Compass**

A depth gauge displays the current and maximum depth reached during a dive. A submersible pressure gauge (SPG) displays the amount of gas remaining in the scuba tank or diving cylinder, which makes you know how long you can stay underwater. Divers must develop the habit of constantly checking the SPG. A compass is used to identify the direction underwater.¬†It is very important in diving, especially when there is low visibility.

Other things you may need for diving include diving gloves, diving boots, line wheel, surface Marker Buoy (SMB), diving headgear, pointer, diving camera, a diving knife and spare mouthpiece, etc.

I am here to ask about a mysterious creature known as ""the black carpet"". 
It seems to be a sort of urban legend among divers.
I was browsing 4chan in the /x/ thing, and found some info about ""the bloop"" sound. 
Some people started saying its actually a creature at least a mile long called ""the black carpet"" which is described as an animal composed of black feelers that walk on the ocean floor, eating up the nutrients.
More info here:

Even though my sister and I nearly died as children drowning, I still love being under water. In pools I used to swim and sit underwater but now it hurts my ears and head to do that without anything to help. I still love being underwater. I can easily say that the only reason I go swimming is so that I can be underwater.  


Now I would love to take a course or class but unfortunately that type of class which requires gear (in my area) and to pay for the class as well is outside of my budget. I would barely be able to afford the gear. So I am looking to learn super gradually myself practicing everything in a pool or shallow river. I am here in Mid-Michigan so all we have are shallow rivers and some small lakes for swimming other than pools.  


I would love to know my options for diving. I know Scuba and Snorkeling but I am curious if there is anything else that could be done. Free diving is not a option for me. If I do do (hehe) snorkeling, is there a snorkel that I do not have to bite onto as I have not any teeth. If it is scuba diving what are some options for minimalist gear? Complete bigger but I would love to take my love for being underwater to the next level.

This last year I was working on my divemaster certification (I live in NYC so there is very limited opportunities to get the dives done) while going to college. Although all that got interrupted, I fully plan on finishing up my cert. 

Recently I have been really thinking about moving to florida (maybe Fort Lauderdale area) and working in a dive shop and eventually get my instructors cert. I just do not know where to start. However, I have so many questions that I do not even know how to begin researching. Will I be able to live on being a divemaster alone or will I need a second job? What are the benefits as a divemaster? How do I even begin looking at apartments? How much money should I save up before moving?

I do not plan on moving down for another year at least. I am gonna take a few years off college, maybe forever, and just work my ass off here and try and save up some money so I can afford everything until I get on my feet. It is never too early to research and look into things though. 

If you moved out when you were young to pursue diving, let me know how you did it please.",0.048,0.859,0.093,0.8857

I absolutely love freshwater diving, maybe more than doing so in an ocean. It‚Äôs been a while since I did my open water license, and tbh I‚Äôm not necessarily trying to go full scuba gear into a 3m deep river. I love snorkelling but when it comes to video projects its probably not gonna give me as stable of a picture. I was wondering if you guys would know a good setup that might make snorkelling and filming easier? I wish they had little rebreather systems for snorkelling so you could extend your dives for one more breath or another. But that‚Äôs wishful thinking.

I‚Äôm an adept diver (have been recreationally diving yearly during the summer months) but the only gear I use is a diving mask and fins (even that ocassionally).

I‚Äôm usually able to dive to the 7-8 meter mark at most (this is without fins) and that‚Äôs usually where I start to hit the incredible ear pain mark even though I desperately try to depressurise (blowing air through my ears/opening up my Eustachian tube - sorry not a native speaker).

Since that‚Äôs the depth I can reach without fins (and just about the depth I can hold my breath for), I‚Äôm pretty certain I‚Äôd be able to dive deeper with them but I usually have to stop and go back up due to the pain..

Is there any way to train myself or depressurise more effectively so I can reach deeper? I really wanna get to all the treasures I can see. :)

0,25,884,"Dive Bag Recommendations? Hi,

I am looking to make a bigger investment in my diving gear (Halcyon Eclypse 30 wings, ScubaPro Jet fins, a generic backplate+harness combo, and a bag to transport it all).

Since I travel to dive, I am looking for a bag that fits the following criteria:

* Can be checked in as luggage (I do not really care for cabin luggage for this application)
* Can be used to transport a full set of gear (my BPW, fins, mask, computer, knife; rented wetsuit, reg, weights, boots, compass, etc.) to the site, maybe with some odds and ends like a water bottle, phone, etc.
* *Ideally*, can take dunking/hosing my gear off and then draining the water - if I have a bag, it would be great if I could do this and leave it at the dive shop overnight for the next day.

So far, the Cressi Gorilla fits my bill - anyone here has any thoughts on that model? Alternatively, any other recommendations for me?",0.025,0.922,0.053,0.6592
0,50,1100,"To dive or not to dive? (corona virus precautions) Hi there. First post here. Complete diving baby (in every sense of the word). I PETER dived last July once (loved it); had my first class last Sunday (5.5 hours with lecture and pool); had my first panic attack reading about everything that can go wrong last night (anxiety mostly assuaged by a diver friend and my instructor since then). 

Kinda surprised I haven‚Äôt found any posts on corona virus and diving in Reddit. Assuming that‚Äôs because there‚Äôs not too many reasons to be concerned unless one shares their regulator with someone else?

I decided to cancel my class today and postpone until next week just to be sure. But my instructor assured me that she disinfects regulator with bleach and water. Plus I am her only student right now and the only one using that particular set of gear. 

Of course there‚Äôs also the question if one should leave their home during a shelter order (I live in SF bay) to do something as luxurious as scuba training. 

Just wondering what folks in here have to say about all this; I‚Äôm sure there will be differing opinions and maybe some controversy?

Also, any local spots to recommend for a beginner?

- buy snorkel ($20), mask ($125), fins ($125) and 3mm wetsuit ($180) before I get certified
- get certified (~$500)
- go on a couple dives for about a year while saving up more money to buy a reg and bcd.

I am planning a trip to Mexico and Guatemala in August and I want to do my PADI Rescue Diver certification while I am there. Does anybody have a reccomendation for a good place and dive shop? As far as I have seen, everybody reccomends Conzumel, is it the best option? I generally prefer smaller, less touristic towns, but I will go wherever the diving is great. Also, any tips on price and discounts will be very welcome. I have dived with shops that had discounts for people staying at certain hostels, could something like this be found in Mexico as well?

&amp;#x200B;

i just got open water certified today. on my second dive, i noticed i was getting nauseous, but nothing happened. today during my 4th dive, i threw up 3 times. it was not a deal-breaker or anything. it just happened and i moved on. 

&amp;#x200B;

it was not due to ingesting saltwater, im thinking more motion-related. i cant look at my phone too long in a moving vehicle and i get nauseous with VR headsets on. so I am guessing this is something similar.

I have  got a bald head and got some minor sunburns during my last dives in  sunny regions. Therefore, I ordered several dive hoods for my next trip  to find a fitting one.

My problem  is: all size L hoods are too tight and feel uncomfortable. Even after a  couple of minutes it feels like I will get a headache.  
XL hoods feel  good and fit easily - maybe too easily? While the diving hood closes  well on my face and lies gently on my ears, it is very loose on my neck  and even leaves some space above my skullcap.

What are the disadvantages of slightly too loose hoods? Will air get trapped inside and make my head float?  
If it matters: The material for the hood I would like to keep is 90 % Neoprene and 10 % Nylon

I am glad for any advice / tips

So as of right now I have no idea how to prevent my ear drum from popping next time I dive, however I have looked at buying ear plugs and a swim cap to make sure no water gets in my ear as I go down. Is this a viable solution? What are your inputs/suggestions?

2. We'll bring our own wetsuits - what mm? full legs and arms?
3. Is there a dive center in FP that is awesome for teaching kids?
4. Not flying for 24 hours after a dive... is that relevant for short island hops? What altitude is the cut off for safety?

I  did my PADI AOW last week, did 7 dives within 3 days, went 30m down for  the deep dive and another time at 30m for the ship wrek. Never had  problem equalizing or never felt any pain under the water  during or  after the dives.

It will append if I blow my nose, if I yawn, if I  chew gun, if I try to equalize at normal pressure, sometime when I  swallow and surprisingly when I took an elevator to the 10th floor of  the building I work at.

If possible id like to buy a suit that could be used in those tropical climates and also here at home in oregon. I read ppl reccomend 5-7mm here.

I am considering the scubapro everflex. Would a 5/4 work for both climates or is it too hot for the tropics? Would i be better off with a 3/2 for vaca and a diffrent suit for home?  Is even a 3/2 too much for snorkeling?

I am going to San Padre Island, TX for a work trip next week (so in early February) and am considering extending for the weekend to go diving there (and to maybe take that refresher course there). Is there good diving there? Is there just as good (or better, or cheaper) diving if I dip into Mexico for the weekend?

I was able to kind of push through the pain and sometimes it would go away if we were down long enough, other times I had to swim back up a few feet and hope it would go away. Which it did a couple times. 

I asked a couple instructors about it and they both just said maybe my mask was on too tight but I had it pretty much as loose as I could get it.

I am flying into Roatan on a Wednesday and not starting the dive course in Utila until Saturday. The course lasts for 4.5 days and then I do not fly out of Roatan until Sunday.   So I have got 2 full days before qualification and three full days after getting qualified that I could be open to doing just about anything.  I am currently considering spending the first two days in Roatan and then taking the ferry to Utila the day before the course, but I suppose some time in La Ceiba could be possible if there are things to see there. Or I could go straight to Utila and just bum around for a few days if the other areas have not got much going on and are unduly expensive to just sit in. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is there a place in the area that would be particularly good to spend a few days without diving before I start the course?

1. Is it smart doing the course already or would it be better doing a dive beforehand so I can see if I like diving? There are some companies offering great barrier reef dives without experience and a certification etc. but I do feel weird diving without proper training. I also never really went snorkeling in my life, so should I go snorkeling first and then see if I like it? (I got some mates snorkels to try them out in a lake and I already loved it)

2. I do am a little bit scared of sharks, but I dont think I will meet a great white shark while diving as a beginner or any other agressiv sharks ( I do want to dive with sharks once in my life)
But im kinda way more scared from the box and irukandji jellyfishes here in australia. Is there a high chance I can get stung by them while im in water?
Or am I stressing myself to much?

3. What are your guys tips to prevent panicking under water? 

4. Im also kinda scared that I fuck up and get decompression sickness. How high is the chance to fuck up? Or is it unlikely to happen if i follow the rules?

Im sorry if these questions sound dumb, but these are likely the only things that prevent me from learning how to dive.

hence currently considering it I should get another g7x mark1 (instead of mark 2 or mark 3 as they didnt fit in my existing case), or buy a gopro+case, or tg-6 + case. from what I read g7x mark 1 is still a better camera than tg-6. but tg-6 is waterproof to 15m, so in case I just jumped in and realise the case wasnt locked properly, then hurriedly lock it (like on my last dive), the camera is still safe. if I buy another g7x, just means I dont need to buy another camera case.",0.009,0.942,0.049,0.7611

My husband and I love snorkeling. I am a good swimmer so I feel very safe in the water for the most part. My husband on the other hand, sinks like a stone. Oddly enough we figured out he floats in the Pacific for some reason! However since he is decidedly NOT a swimmer, he needs a snorkel vest as a safety precaution. We already have the ""traditional"" vest, that almost like a life vest and you just blow it up in the front, and it is just got straps around the back and the crotch strap. He HATES the thing. He finds it rides up and chokes him, which is a no go. I have been looking for a vest that will not have this problem, however my barrel-chested babe has a 54"" inch chest..... I think you can see the problem.

Does anyone have any recommendations? I have been googling my fingers off, but no dice. If anyone can help with a link or any store, that would be amazing. Thanks everyone for your help in advance!",0.063,0.756,0.181,0.9723
