I’m always horrified to learn that so many shipwrecks kill large numbers of people, and I can’t help but wonder what the reason is. I’m not being facetious here: are there really that many people that don’t know how to swim? Or can they swim but they get tired and give up when rescue takes too long? Or do they freeze to death? Or eaten by sharks? Or sucked under with the ship? What are the most common reasons for death after a shipwreck?",0.229,0.69,0.081,-0.9795

We're visiting several different communities on reddit and elsewhere in search of two things:

1. Organizations making an immediate impact to preserve the biosphere and reduce atmospheric carbon that are in need of funding right now.

2. Forests, waterways and other wildlife habitats that are currently available for sale and in danger of being bought by commercial entities such as logging, mining, drilling and development companies. 

Links to existing lists and organizational hubs are also welcome. We want to find ongoing and especially time-sensitive causes that are in immediate need of funding. We're looking to be as comprehensive as possible, so every suggestion is sincerely appreciated!",0.026,0.85,0.124,0.8908

1,26,1155,"Are the Oceans killing us?  An extinction cycle happens on Earth that goes like this:

\-the planet begins to warm from greenhouse gases

\-this warms the oceans, and melts the ice

\-this alters the currents in the ocean which mix oxygen into deeper waters

\-the oceans begin to lose oxygen, species begin to die

\-methane/sulfur bacteria from the ocean floor begin to bloom in the low-oxygen water

\-kills off ocean life, emits poison hydrogen sulfide gas into atmosphere

\-life on land is poisoned/suffocated

&amp;#x200B;

Other factors that contribute to this cycle:

\-volcanic eruptions heat the planet and add sulfur to air

\-passing comets add toxic dust into atmosphere/ocean - helping the bacterial blooms

\-the magnetic poles shift, creating a temporarily weaker magnetic field on Earth, letting in harmful UV rays

\-solar flare or micronova

&amp;#x200B;

Seems like we are well into the cycle. So not good news for life that needs oxygen.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ASWAP (Autonomous Sub-aquatic Waste Acquiring and Pre-processing) unit:

It is well known that underwater waste has a **massive destructive** effect on life **above and below** water.

Not only does it directly **harm and kill** living organisms underwater but it also influences the rest of the ecosystem by reducing the ocean plants (which contribute 50-85% of the O2 production on earth) level by approximately **40% since the 80s**.

The ASWAP unit can collect underwater waste and sort them **automatically** using a weakly supervised waste detection model and a waste classification model.

By sending a drone underwater to collect waste, we are removing the need of a trained worker who would ordinarily have to face the **dangers of the depths** to accomplish the same tasks.

One of the greatest issues faced in the ocean cleanup projects today is the **handling of waste** after it is collected. We use **advanced** classification models (92+% accuracy) to sort garbage in our docking stations so that it can be recycled and resold.

Our solution can **safely and efficiently** remove waste debris from underwater areas which may be less accessible to humans, and thus protect the ecosystem.

1,100,4108,"Looking for marine field experience, in the US, that pays well? Become a Protected Species Observer! Hi everyone, I work as a protected species observer (PSO) and the company I contract for is looking to recruit more observers for upcoming projects.

Whats a PSO? When a company wants to do a marine geological survey of any kind, be it oil, windmills, or construction, they are required to have PSO onboard to watch out for Marine Mammals, Sea turtles, and other protected species to mitigate any potential damage the survey equipment can cause.

What do I need to be a PSO? Theres a few certifications that are required, as well as your own gear. After you have gotten everything certified you will probably be $2000 in the hole, however you easily earn this amout back after your first month. The nice thing is if you file your taxes you can write off most of the expenses on your taxes. I can earn a sign up bonus for everyone I recruit so to prevent people from just reading this post and going through the certification themselves, I wont list everything, gotta look out for #1.

Whats a day in the life of a PSO like? Im currently working on a video about this very thing. You pretty much stare at the ocean on a boat, miles from land until you spot a protected species. Then after figuring out if the animal is close enough to be potentially affected by the survey equipment you get to shut down the boats operations. There are incredibly boring days, and there are incredible days where youll see 12 Humpback whales feeding in an upwelling next to the boat, or a group of 70 dolphins follow the boat for hours. We also see tons of other wildlife, sharks, birds, turtles, ect. You have to fill out paper work on the protected species but thats pretty much the hardest thing you have to do. I listen to podcasts, music, and audio books while I am on watch, so you can be some what productive. The Starting pay for PSOs is a day rate and is typically 150-200 a day, but I have been doing this for a year already and have made more than 300$ a day on some projects.

A typical schedule is not something I have had in my exeperience as a PSO. Some PSOs work a constant 5 week on, 5 week off shift. This has not been my experience. Im currently on a project expected to last 2 months, Ive also been projects as short as 11 days. But I also follow the money, whereever the highest pay is, is usually where I am, but some people might prefer a lower day rate in exchange for a more consistent schedule. Thats gonna be more your call.

Whats life like offshore? Mostly what you make of it. I work about 13 hours a day, and out of that time I am on watch for 7-8 hours. the rest of my time, I finish paper work. I also work on scripts for my youtube channel, edit photographs of animals I have seen, work out, eat, watch movies.

What are some disqualifying things for working offshore? The internet is pretty shit offshore, just enough to send emails, and texts, so if you need daily internet this job isnt for you. Honestly though, its wonderful to unplug for a few weeks at a time. Also if you experience motion/sea sickness easily, however most people adapt after a few days. You also need to pass a drug test, which is a huge bummer when you work out of states that are recreationally legal (looking at you Massachusetts). Medical marijuana is still disqualifying, theres no exceptions, they will straight up call a helicopter to pick you up if you fail an on vessel drug test.

Some perks. You get paid to watch wildlife. You get paid pretty well. You can log your sea days for a captains license. International work on all seven continents and all five oceans is a availible (You'll have to be competitive for them however). You can get certifications in Passive acoustic monitoring (Opens up more international work, and higher pay.)

TL;DR: Get paid to watch marine life.

If this sounds like something you want more info on as a career, feel free to comment here, or DM me. Im in port until Tuesday so Ill answer what I can. Ill be offshore on a project for a few weeks and ill answer more when we return to port. You can also check out my instagram for pictures of wildlife i've seen offshore @ Barefoot\_zak.",0.055,0.85,0.095,0.9753

My friend and I were swimming in Mirmar, FL awhile back (beach known for drownings) and we weren’t planning on going too far out into the water but before we know it neither one of us could touch and even though we were swimming, we weren’t getting anywhere. The water wasn’t pulling us under but it was pulling us away from shore. When we finally got back to our resort that night we were looking up what a rip current was and we ended up learning that an entire family drowned at the exact same beach we were at, at the exact same time we were there. Do you think we were stuck in a rip current? And if we were, how do we get out of it safely because all swimming did was make our arms sore, and screaming for help was useless over the loud crashing waves.",0.113,0.831,0.056,-0.8782

Save Our Seas Saturdays are asking you and your group/org to participate in our first ever Global SOS on June 6th, just before World Oceans Day. Normally we would go to our nearest beach or river every Saturday to pick litter and share a photo online but we have moved to taking action digitally due to the pandemic. We are demanding systemic change from governments and corporations to protect our oceans from threats like climate change, plastic pollution and more. Our first ever Global SOS on June 6th will be part of our week of digital action that we’re currently planning. You can get involved by following us on social media @SosSaturdays and on June 6th, take a photo of yourself with a sign about the oceans and share it on your social media, similar to Climate Strike Online. Don’t forget to use #SOSSaturdays too! If you want to help us plan this incredible day of digital action or help coordinate SOS Saturdays in general, please sign up on this website (https://www.saveourseasglobal.org/) to join our workspace. Hope you can join us in fighting for our oceans on June 6th, and there’s lots more info on our website and social media.

Does anyone know of blogs that focus on both the science of marine biology. But also the media surrounding it? Video games,  collectables etc.

Got a couple questions which Id like to have an answer for. I have tried doing a google search but I see to be going in circles. 

&amp;#x200B;

How can i find the border to an ocean such as the Atlantic Ocean? Where does the Pacific edge end?  It started with a caption of my friends saying they are swimming in the Atlantic while living in PEI. I believe that its actually the Gulf of St.Lawrence which made me wonder if , me living on the west coast ,have I ever swam in the actual Pacific? Or was it a strait or gulf or whatever else.

I run a scuba diving/freediving blog, and I have been doing a Q&amp;A with people who are in the diving industry; eg. an UW photographer, a commercial diver, and others. And have a few up-coming interviews with a freediving champion and scuba diving course directors.

I am interested in doing a Q&amp;A with a working marine biologist or coral researcher. Questions would be about your daily work life, coolest/weirdest things you have seen, how to get into the industry, etc.

Please let me know if you would like to be interviewed. I would send you a list of questions to answer, and you will need to provide 2-3 photos of you or your job.

1,62,2124,"How would you classify the different threats to biodiversity ? Hello,

I am making a detailed **list of environmental threats**; but before making it ""official"", I would like to know your opinion about the ***main*** **and** ***sub*** **categories** of those threats. I am taking marine life example.

For now, here is my classification :

* **Pollution :** Pure Unwanted/**Collateral**  effects of human activities. This include sub-classes of pollution,  maybe chemical (the most common), physical (nets), biological  (algae?),or even energetic (light, sound, radioactivity, heat ?)
* **Poaching :** Targeting **specific** species to gain money by selling it, dead or alive. Poaching can also create collateral effects on other species.
* **Over-fishing :** Targeting edible species, but in a **gluttonous**   way, without any care, making the resources slowly wither away. This   often create collateral effects on other species AND environment, like  the nets **scraping** the coral reef. Or the **electro** fishing...
* **Bad reputation** : Targeting species just to **wipe them** out of the globe, because they have a bad reputation of human/cattle killer The best example is the Great White Shark.
* **Ethic problems :** Ways of treating species without any care for their **suffering**. This include dolphin shows, or seafood eaten alive.
* **Environment conquest :** Targeting the environment to transform it or use it in another way. This include **deforestation** to grow crops, for example. Or even some **mangrove fish farming.**
* **Global warming effects :** All the direct **consequences** of global warming. I do not know if it deserve a category tough, since global warming is caused by CO2/CH4/other **gases pollution**, but there is so **many effects** that it may have it is **own category**.

I do not know where to put **collision** with animals (manatee), and general **stress** due to the sole human presence.  
And maybe add somewhere **genetic** pollution, and **invasive** species. However IDK if it is a **main** category or a **sub** category.

What do you think ? Do you have any proposition for ***main*** classes AND ***sub***\-classes of environmental threats ?",0.109,0.771,0.12,0.5149

I study Physics (and Chemistry). I have to do a very important project with pretty strict conditions. The theme is ""Oceans"". Unfortunately I am not familiar with it and struggle to find an idea.   


&amp;#x200B;

Here are the conditions for the thing to be relevant for such a project :  


\- I *have* to be able to do **experiments** (for instance, a friend is studying the heat regulation system of whales, and thus is mesuring the thermic diffusion through whale skin and whale fat)  


\- It cannot be related to biology (so nothing related to hormones or proteins production, digestive systems, etc.) 

  
\- Morphology-related phonomenons, such as the punch of the shrimp mantis, *are* *welcome*, because they can be interpreted strictly from a physicist is point of view.  


&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for reading. I hope you will be able to help me !!! Anything can help !

Why a whale sanctuary?
———

Animals that have been in captivity for most of, if not their entire, lives cannot be expected to be able to sustain themselves independently in the wild. A sanctuary for these animals will give them an environment 300-400 times the size of the biggest known tank, the opportunity to swim freely in straight lines, hunt and forage for their own food, socialize naturally, and interact with the natural world. 
     For a lot of these animals, moving to a sanctuary would be the first opportunity they’ve had to feel the ocean, to see live fish, to experience tides, rub against rocks, and everything else a wild animal should be able to able to experience.

The Whale Sanctuary Project
———

    There are currently over 50 experts working on the Whale Sanctuary Project, spanning multiple professions and areas of interest. The Whale Sanctuary Project is the first organization solely dedicated to creating seaside sanctuaries in North America for whales, dolphins, and porpoises who are being retired from the entertainment industry, or animals who have been rescued from the wild and need rehabilitation or permanent care. This facility would be the first of it’s kind, and a huge step in removing the animals currently in captivity from their current situation. Conservation is, of course, very important, but this project is about restoring something we humans so selfishly have taken from these highly intelligent, socially complex creatures by forcing them to live in captivity for our entertainment. If there are no sanctuaries built, these animals are destined to continue performing until they die. 
     Instead of the concrete walls of a tank, the animals released into the sanctuary will live in a dynamic and complex world ready for them to interact with. The sanctuary will be in a netted-off area such as a bay or a cove. All of the proposed sites have over 100 acres (484,000 sq. yards) with an average depth of 50 feet (15 meters) throughout. that’s over 400 times the size of the largest display tank at a high-end marine park. 
     There will be rigorous environmental impact studies to be sure the sanctuary will have no negative effects on the wildlife already calling the area home.  The first phases of development would include the enclosure barriers, infrastructure, lab, medical and sanitation services, food prep services, security, and animal care facilities. Future phases would provide opportunities for internships, visitors centers, and the type of equipment needed to enhance our educational outreach, such as underwater cameras and hydrophones.
     Depending on the location chosen and the kind of infrastructure needed to be built, a rough estimate for the cost of a sanctuary would be around $20 million. The long-term care of the facility and the animals would be payed through endowments, sustaining donations, and other revenue-generating opportunities, such as educational materials and programs. The project was launched with a $200,000 donation from Munchkin, Inc., the global baby product company. The company has pledged a total of at least $1 million towards the completion of the sanctuary.

How can we help?

Keep the conversation going - on social media, with friends and family, at school and in the workplace. Social media is quickly becoming the stage in which effective change happens. Encourage everyone you know NOT to buy a ticket to MarineLand, SeaWorld, or any other marine park that exhibits these animals. On the website,  https://whalesanctuaryproject.org, you can donate directly to the cause, and also sign up for a newsletter that will keep you updated on the progress being made. The team is always looking to add people whose skills can contribute to the cause.",0.037,0.795,0.168,0.9984

Unlike a lot of other areas where there is a city nearby, this area was facing the gulf of Thailand and was hundreds of miles away from a major city.   Yet, plastic was floating in from everywhere.

This is the problem I  am seeing more and more as I travel, spend time looking at cities, and  working with this issue. We need a fresh look at how we are going to  actually address the issues, be it through the design of products, consumer awareness, waste management, and ocean cleanup.

There simply is no magic bullet, ocean vacuum, or bio-plastic that will do it all.

Therefore, this paper analyzes the factors affecting resource assessment of Thunnus alalonga. The analysis results show the following results: (1) The quality of catch volume, body length composition or age composition data of the Indian Ocean albacore tuna fishery is affected by unreported, unreported or misreported fishery data, too low sample number and changes in sampling protocol, etc. (2) Although the catch per unit effort (CPUE) was standardized, the quality of standardized CPUE data was still seriously affected by the change of target species and spatial distribution of catch effort. (3) Studies on population ecology and reproductive biology of albacore tuna in the Indian Ocean are still relatively weak, and information on population structure, reproduction, growth and natural death is relatively lacking. In resource assessment, relevant parameter Settings need to be borrowed from the research results of other ocean regions. (4) The Marine environment has a significant impact on the resource change and spatial distribution of albacore tuna in the Indian Ocean, but the assessment model seldom considers the impact of Marine environment. Due to the above problems, the current assessment results are uncertain. In the future, we should continue to explore ways to improve the quality of resource assessment and establish a management strategy evaluation framework to avoid the impact of the uncertainty of fishery resource assessment results on the sustainable development of the fishery.

First, has anyone ever actually been to the Oceanic point of inaccessibility? That'll kind of scuttle my story right there, but I could not find a straight answer online. 

Second, I assumed it was hard to get to because it is such a long straight line out in the ocean without any land to stop on. If it really is inaccessible, is that why? Or is there more to it than just distance?

There are continents in the middle enveloped by an outer ocean. I know that in real life currents carry water in circles between the equator and higher latitudes but how the hell would they work here?

I just launched this game to fund coral restoration projects : [cryptocorals](https://cryptocorals.co/).

It is like tinder but for corals. 

You buy a cryptocoral for 12$ and it funds the plantation of a real coral by our partner [NGO SECORE](http://www.secore.org/site/).

Then, the idea is to breed your reefreshing cryptocorals to reach a super coral which will be reseastant to the next heat wave.

I would love to hear your thougts about it ❤️

Thanks for your help!!

My initial thought was to study aerospace engineering and work for NASA or ESA etc. That way my passion for natural science, engineering, and exploration would be covered. But that is a very far-fetched dream. And if I did not get to work for these big organisations, I could work for companies that produce satellites or passenger planes with a degree in aerospace engineering, but that would only cover natural science and engineering.

Then I thought about the oceans. It has been said a lot of times that we know more about the space than our own oceans. What if I focused on exploring the oceans instead of space?

&amp;#x200B;

My questions are:

1) With a passion for natural science (*not necessarily* physics), engineering, and exploration, what job(s) will let me explore the oceans?

1a) How likely am I to get the job(s) in question 1) (entry difficulty)?

1b) What education do I need to get the job(s) in question 1)?

&amp;#x200B;

2) What if I scratch my passion for natural science and/or engineering, what job(s) will let me explore the oceans?

1a) How likely am I to get the job(s) in question 2) (entry difficulty)?

1b) What education do I need to get the job(s) in question 2)?

3) What else is there left to explore than space and the oceans?

Hi guys!

First time posting on here, so I am not sure if this is allowed or not. Anyway here goes.

My name is Sebastian, I am 20 and I am the founder of Surf'n'Clean. Surf'n'Clean is a non-profit aimed at reducing ocean plastic pollution through a range of eco-friendly products aimed at surfers and beachgoers.

Our main product right now is the SurfPocket, which is a mesh-like pocket that goes on the front of a surfboard. This allows surfers to pick up rubbish whilst they are surfing.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/3zpni33nfvo21.jpg

Currently we are still in the development phase, and have launched a crowdfunding page to try and get us to the production and manufacturing stage. You can find more information on our website ( [www.surfnclean.com](https://www.surfnclean.com/)) or on our social medias (@surfnclean)

It would mean a lot if you could have a look and give feedback!

(will not post link to crowdfunding until admins give me the go ahead)

Volunteer Opportunity:

Swimmer and ocean advocate Ben Lecomte is looking for new crew members to volunteer on a 3-month swimming/sailing expedition from Hawaii to California. 

After spending 165 days at sea and swimming over 1500 nautical miles off the coast of Japan in 2018, Ben and crew were amazed by the ocean and all the random encounters with wildlife, more surprising than the wildlife however was the daily encounters with plastic and marine trash. Driven by this confronting experience, Ben and crew now plan to head into the highest concentration of ocean plastic in the world, commonly known as the ‘Great Pacific Garbage Patch’. 

They are seeking marine engineers, scientists, sailors, medics, videographers, photographers, influencers and plastic warriors available from May to September 2019. The crew will support Ben’s swim through the patch, while collecting scientific samples and sharing their story with the goal to raise awareness on plastic pollution and help uncover the myth of the ‘Great Pacific Garbage Patch’. 

Previous sailing experience is preferred but not required. For your chance to be involved in this huge adventure like [https://www.facebook.com/BenLecomteTheSwim/](https://www.facebook.com/BenLecomteTheSwim/) and send an introduction letter + CV to the team at [join@thelongestswim.com](mailto:join@thelongestswim.com)

I have to pass exams in about a year and a part of these is a personal project. The point is to find a subject linked one way or another to the Ocean, as well as to Physics and/or Chemistry (level : 2nd year of University). I have one or two ideas but it is really stressing me out as I am not super confident about them. The thing is, I do not know much about interesting, surprising things about the ocean worth to research on. I would like to avoid pollution-problems and acidity-levels as they are really common themes. If you could help, that would be awesome. (I keep on checking r/oceans as well for ideas but it seems to -understandably- stick to animals and pollution)

I hope you can help me here. Have a nice day !

From the Medium article: 

When looking at Ocean Technology, it’s important to think about the problems that can be solved.

* Huge pile of microplastic sludge in the ocean needs to be cleaned
* Water is a scarce resource for some countries, the ocean is not, can we filter it and give drinkable water to people at a low cost?
* More accurate weather forecasting
* There are cables in the ocean that connect the countries communications, can it be done better?
* Real Estate play: Humans living beneath the surface of the water — why hasn’t this happened?
* Tourism — Less people have seen the sunken titanic than climb Mt. Everest every Month
* Aquaculture is a multi trillion dollar market — There is so much opportunity.

I’ve been trying to “get back to” the rhythms of nature, but I know so little about those rhythms that I do not know what is important, what to focus on. A calendar seemed to me the best way to organize the information.

I wanted to make a calendar that could help me *feel* the world around me, not just pretty pictures of it.

As I talked about it with others, it seemed like there might be wider interest. So, I made my first ever [Kickstarter, which is now LIVE](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1081428080/a-moon-calendar-and-seasonal-companion-quickstarte?ref=6psqk7)!

You can look at the calendar, and of course pledge now to get your very own copy. Shipping will be in mid- to late February, so you will not have to wait long! (The calendar starts in spring, at the beginning of the natural year.)

After having two trips get cancelled due to COVID travel restrictions I am going to go on my first diving trip. I am a washington native and I grew up skin diving/snorkelling in the Puget Sound. I currently live in Michigan and I plan to do some fresh water dives to check ship wrecks. Lastly, it is my goal to try to get to the Caribbean at least once a year to try new dive spots.

Knowing this expected cadence of dives, does anyone have any suggestions for what basic gear to start picking up? I am thinking mask and fins to start and to rent the rest. Any suggestions for a beginners mask?

Lastly, I am interested to hear about any must see dive spots.

Thanks in advance for your advice!",0.015,0.911,0.074,0.7815

0,25,884,Diving For Leak Detection I work as a pool and spa repair technician for a large builder in south Texas. Recently I’ve been asked to take on the role of leak detector indefinitely. I have used a department suit every cold season since I’ve started for light and drain repairs but only for a handful of weeks a year and was never involved in the buying process. Most were too large as I am 6’ 140lbs so I would use athletic tape on the neoprene cuffs to help with a positive seal. I would love any suggestions for brands and models to look into. I was very impressed with the suits that had the gore-Tex seals. This would be for almost daily use in fall and winter at multiple jobs a day so durability and easy of entry are ideal but also something I can trust to keep me dry so I don’t drain my self burning calories to warm up. I also do not use scuba but a bonnies tankless air pump and hose with mouthpiece.,0.018,0.792,0.19,0.9884
0,46,1405,"Cleaning and maintenance of dive light O-rings The O-ring is the very important spare part on the dive light. It creates a rotating, static, and sliding seal for your dive lights, keeping components of the light safe from contaminants and flooding. When you dive in salt water or murky water, tiny particles may work their way into the seal, leading to a leak. So it needs regular cleaning and maintenance for O-rings.

Start by soaking the light in fresh water to to dissolve the majority of the dried salt at the seal. Dry the gear and open it. Then, by pinching the O-ring between your thumb and forefinger, remove the O-ring with your fingers. Do not use anything sharp or metallic. 

Once the o-ring is safely removed, wipe all dirt and grease from the ring using a soft and clean cloth. Inspect the o-ring for cuts, nicks and any signs of wear. Replace the O-ring if its worn or damaged. 

To lubricate the o-ring, place a small dab of silicon grease on your fingers and run your fingers over the o-ring until it’s evenly coated and shiny. Make sure that it’s greased enough but not too greasy either. An O-ring which has been lubricated properly is smooth and slick with grease. This lets it properly slide into the groove on the dive light and create a nice, tight seal.  

There is video about O-ring maintenance for your reference:

0,52,1074,"Do you get proper primary and secondary dive lights? Primary light is the one you generally use, and if the primary light fails during a dive, you switch to a backup light. What are the differences between them? 

The primary dive lights should be:

* They are robust and powerful.
* They have long burn times.
* They are higher in power, and brighter for deeper uses.

The secondary dive lights usually are:

* They are more compact, smaller and lighter in weight.
* They have shorter burn times.
* They are typically less powerful, but sufficient enough to serve as a backup.

Carrying a backup light on your dive is a good idea. You never know when your primary dive light will die out, or if you are going on longer dives, it’s always worthwhile to have a secondary dive light with you for those deeper, darker depths you plan going through. For example, you can take [D26 1600](https://www.xtar.cc/product/XTAR-D26-1600-Diving-Flashlight-43.html) as your primary dive light and [D20 1000](https://www.xtar.cc/product/XTAR-D20-1000-Diving-Flashlight-143.html) as your secondary light.

But do you know your backup dive light can also do it? With proper position and composition, you can shot unique images without the extra cost of a strobe. 

Why? As you know, the Macro shooting is shot the macro subjects up close. Only a single point of light is needed to illuminate the macro creatures and make them show their original colors. That is enough. In that case, a dive torch with narrow beams can do it.

Using this dive torch to create a spotlight, you can actually see the beam range before shooting a picture.  

Bright your dive light around the side of the subject, rather than head-on. It can create the slide lighting. It could accentuate textures and make the image a bit moodier. Handy dive light works well especially for subjects in the sand such as stargazer and seahorses, which aren’t too skittish to move if you place a dive torch close by. 

Dive torches can also be used to backlight for sedentary subjects. If the subject doesn’t move at all, then you can simply rest the torch in the sand or an empty spot. However, if the subject is swimming or in the water column, then you’ll need another diver to hold the light. 

What’s your experience? More tips and suggestions are always welcomed.",0.015,0.916,0.069,0.9092

He is a State Parks Lifeguard and frequent surfer (we live Coastside in NorCal) so is used to swimming in the ocean, and a freshly minted Gaucho at UCSB, looking at Marine Bio as a major. Hopefully, he will finally get to move down there in January. I see there are two or three PADI certified training centers down there and I am looking to get him the whole package, training and personal equipment. I went through the training 20 years ago and know he will love it. Any opinions on one center over another? Any tips or advice?

0,45,2330,"18lbs or 30lbs -- enough lift? Dive Gear Help Hello fellow Redditors,

I am newbie so pardon my ignorance - I am getting my certificate later this month. I live in South Florida and my best friend, who is an avid diver, is getting married late Spring 2021. He is been trying to get me into diving for years but between work, travel, baby, money... it took a push. The push came in the form of a diving trip bachelor party for 7 days and an expected 25+ dives. I am jumping in head first - I want to buy some equipment and get taught in that equipment. The bachelor party diving will be happening(covid willing) in St. Lucia or the like in Feb/March 2021.

Here is where I need help. I have done extensive research and have narrowed down two different setups for BCD but I am stuck between the two. If you have made it this far and you area an experienced diver - maybe you can help - and thank you in advance if you can.

I like the simple approach of wing, backplate and harness. I have no interest in a jacket style BCD. I will almost exclusively be diving the Caribbean or south Florida for the foreseeable future. I am 5'11"" and 190lbs and a strong swimmer (do not know if any of that is relevant)

**Q: Do I get the Apeks One piece harness WITH the SS Apeks backplate +Apeks WTX D30 wing or WITH aluminum Apeks backplate + Apeks WTX D18 wing?**

I plan on using a standard weight belt that I use for lobstering/pole fishing for lead. I have 16lbs in 2lbs increments and a standard rubber belt. I do not know how many pounds I will need yet to be zero buoyant. I will be using neoprene tech shorts for storage. Again - do not know if any of this helps.

I will be traveling with it but the weight difference of 5lbs does not seem to make a difference between alum and SS in the backplate. I would simply use the SS as more weight requiring less for my belt. I chose those combinations thinking that would be the most efficient combo --- I could be wrong and correct me if I am not. If I missed the mark entirely - please provide constructive criticism and tell me what I should get. :- )

Side note: I am leaning towards the aluminum backplate and 18lb wing as my wife (5'5"" and 130 lbs) could potentially use it if it is not enough lift for me so potentially no harm - no foul.

I am about to buy a diving computer as I plan to get more serious about diving (currently at advanced level, 25 dives).

Initially I wanted to buy the Cressi Giotto diving computer (many recommendations, bit better than his little brother the Leonardo model and quite affordable).

Now, I stumpled upon Suunto is D5 during some research. I was immedialy stunned by its modern yet simplistic information interface. I do not know if you relate you it, but I find some diving computer displays a bit tricky to read.. it is seems a little crammed sometimes. The Suunto clearly has more modern featuers and looks. However, it is also double in price.

My question is, do you think it is worth investing in the Suunto D5 model? If you have experience with it, what are your thoughts and would you recommend it? Is it worth double the price of the Cressi Giotto?

Hoping someone may have gone through something similar and can show me the light. I should also note I am not particularly new to diving; I have roughly 80 dives under my belt without issues.

Back in December, I was on a dive with a lot of surge bringing me up and down and my ear started to not feel right. According to DAN resources, all signs pointed to a middle ear barotrauma. As I was not in my home state (yay US health care!), I couldn’t afford to see an out of network MD until I got home. Between work, COVID, required referrals in the US, and appts being booked months away, it took A WHILE to finally get seen by an ENT (today…). 

Back in December, on my flight home, I had SEVERE pain in my ear. Thankfully the flight was quick. Since then, the pain has only been a dull ache for the most part but certain things set it off to being more painful like cold/wind/water/loud noises/physically pushing on my ear. Trying to swim in a cold lake recently and my ear was very uncomfortable. I’ve been taking Flonase daily for the last couple months to no avail 

Flash-forward to today. I get a hearing test and the results are normal. I get an ENT to look into my ears and nose and throat and that’s all normal. He can’t figure it out. Says I have no fluid, no infection...

I just want to be able to dive again but if it hurts to swim at the surface, I’m sure down with pressure will be extra painful! Free diving a few feet below the surface HURTS.

I recently started the search for a backplate/wing setup. I noticed some companies tend to offer 2 types of straps. The basic type that need to be set up once and kept the same for all dives and the ""deluxe"" versions. Versions that have clips like a regular bcd to offer easyer adjustment and are more targeted towards rec divers.
(example: xdeep zen VS xdeep zen deluxe) 

What are your opinions about those ""deluxe"" versions?
I am a rec diver and often change between a 7mm wetsuit and a 7mm with an extra 7mm on top. Thus I was thinking of getting an adjustable one. However I read on some forums that it is not at all needed even for a change in wetsuit.
Any divers here with some experience on this topic?

The thing is, I have just catched a couple planes, and I spent the whole flight not equalized until it went down, and the second one was fine until it went down, gosh my ears never hurt so bad. I know 3 ways to equalize, plus my own way, and none were the tiniest bit useful.

Looking for a little wisdom please.

Background:
So, I am currently based in the UK and dive a handful of times a year when travelling for fun and work (outdoor instructor and expedition leader) 

Thing is, as cash is always tight I either borrow or rely on my dive buddies for computer related info.

However, I am about to move to Dakar and plan on working through my certs over the next year or so (Currently only OW) but would like to equip myself with a computer from a UK based company (cost, warranty, repair etc will be easier this way when I visit the home) that will work for me at my current level but also be suitable on my journey through the certs. (End goal is definitely dive instruction for more international employment oppos)

Have used Suunto Zoops so far and like them, if that helps. 

So yeah, advice please?

Title pretty much says it all but was really cool.  Going to be editing a video at some point with some footage but about an hour ago the young lady who lost her cell phone had her Aunt come and pick it up from me.  It had been lost around mid April 2019 and I found it yesterday 8/24/20.  Phone was in a plastic case that helped protect it from getting wet but the MicroSD card was not working as I tried to get some info from that first.  Was eventually able to unlock the phone and get the email address for the owner.  About 30 minutes after I contacted her I got a reply and was setup to hand it over.  I know that the young lady had likely already replaced the phone but still with how times are I can imagine it could turn into a little extra cash for her or maybe save not needing a replacement if the phone she is currently using is damaged or of a lesser quality.  

Went down already planning to pull a bunch of trash out of the water and accomplished that pretty well though there was some other stuff I could not possible remove at this point so had to leave it.

I’ve never actually swam in the ocean as I live about 8 hours from the coast and the lakes near me are extremely murky so the deepest swimming pool in my area is only 13ft and that’s extremely easy to get to the bottom but the only way to walk on the bottom is to let out all my breath but once I do that I can only stay down there for 30 seconds to a minute.

0,59,1279,"Diving / Swimming under water in maximal depth of 2 meters. Hello there,

i have a (stupid?) question on diving or underwater swimming in the local swimming pool at a maximal depth of 2, maybe 3 meters.

Short things first I have ear problems on both my ears, but especially on my right one, where the ear drum is deformed and has scars on it, which gives a feeling of permanent ear pressure or.. inflammation or something like that.
Since I really love swimming and diving in low water Situations but kinda cannot because of this reason.

Now my question is: 

Can I go diving / swimming under water with ear plugs, that do not have a membrane for water pressure in it? Or is it too dangerous to do it like that. 
My ear plugs would be made at my hearing aid provider with a perfect fit ear plug for around 80€ made of some sort od silicon or rubber like material.

If not, are there any serious alternatives to that? Ive read about plugs with holes / specific membranes in it that helped a lot of people, but was not sure if it helped in my case.. 

Im sorry for the dumb question, since I think this sub is not particularly the right for my purposes. 
It would be maximum 3 meters of depth. And even if I wanted to do snorling im reefs it would be around the same depth. 
And sorry for my bad english, it is not my Mother language.

Mask-- female, medium size face I guess? Accepting any and all recommendations.

Snorkel-- I have gotten the sense from reading that dry is a bad idea for freediving; what about semi-dry?

I am just wondering because I have been looking around the internet for quite some time which would be better DIT Seattle or ocean Corp Texas, DIT Seattle seems like it is a great school and has better job placement but it is quite substantially more expensive and it does not provide housing neither does Texas but Texas is $19,000 compared to Seattle which is $30,000 probably offers more too. I know salvage diving is kind of different from scuba diving because the air is surface supplied I am just looking for opinions from professional divers who have a little bit more experience than me any information from you guys would be a great help because I am thinking of going with Texas but I am unsure.

I love to free dive and lobster dive during the season and have been doing so for around 4-5 years now. I used to be able to hit 50ft(15m) every dive pretty easy up until about two years ago, for some reason I began having trouble equalizing and now can max out at 50ft(15m) on my first 1-3 dives and then usually end up diving no deeper than 10-20ft(3-6m) depending on the day. 

My left ear feels totally fine, however my right ear is having problems, when I put my finger just under where my ear starts(just below the earlobe) and where the top of my jaw flexes it feels like theres a tiny pea sized air bubble there and is not there on the left side.

I am wondering if anyone has heard or experienced this themselves as I think it might be the cause to my problems if it is affecting my Eustachian tube. Its been there for about 2 years now(at least thats when I noticed it) and I am wondering what it is.

I have an issue with my eardrum, where it is perforated and will not heal on its own. I can get surgery for it, and I did, only for it to end up undone. My doctor told me that because part of my ear never fully developed, trying to seal it will just cause eardrum to get filled up with wax again, causing me to go back to having tubes again...So there is essentially no point in sealing it.

Now I know getting water in the ears is going to cause all sorts of issues, such as ear infections, imbalance, pain (massive pain), and so on. Is this obstacle something I can get around, or should I give up? I am mainly asking for my curiosity is sake.",0.065,0.917,0.018,-0.8204

\- Searching and recovering drowned victims or items used as evidence  
\- Being on-call 24/7  
\- Diving in low viz, cold, or at altitude

I found it highly fascinating as it is not something that recreational scuba divers really think about. Usually, I am in tropical waters with good visibility, diving for fun. I know I did not know much about this career or job until the interview, and I learned a lot from his answers.

I hope you guys enjoy it! Let me know if there is a diver in another industry who I should interview.

0,33,4731,"What gears do you need for diving Diving equipment is the guarantee of diving safety for divers. Good-looking, fashionable and technological are all based on safety, reliability and comfort. Diving equipment can be prepared by yourself or rented on various islands. Now let us take a look at what equipment to prepare for diving. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yljfbd7foc851.png?width=1135&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=93abf5fc47a7c2576a13ba0c88d724ca8fb8cf29

**Diving Mask &amp; Snorkel**

A diving mask (or dive mask/scuba mask) allows you to see the breathtaking surroundings clearly under the water. The three elements of best choice are comfort, good vision, and anti-fogging. The masks should be in good quality and the frame should be suitable for your face shape. 

As for snorkels, not every diver will need one. However, it’s normally suggested for beginners to carry one, while more experienced divers will see it as optional. This breathing tube comes in handy when you’re swimming facedown on the surface. In addition, snorkels also help to save the air in your tank.

**Diveskin &amp; Wetsuits**

Diveskin is suitable for wearing in tropical waters. It can be worn on the inside of the wetsuits, which is convenient for taking off the wetsuits and also protecting your skin.

The thickness of wetsuits is between 1-5mm, suitable for the environment with a water temperature of 10-20 degrees. Wetsuits should fit your body (generally tighter is appropriate), provide less positive buoyancy and have good waterproof performance. 

**Fins**

Fins are generally matched with diving boots. They give you control over your movement and allow you to propel yourself through the water with speed and agility. Fins are divided into open heel and full-foot. Within those two categories, it finds two more variants - blade or split.

Open heel fins are commonly used in cold water. Full-foot fins completely cover your feet and are normally used in warmer water. 

**Scuba Tank or** **Diving Cylinder**

A scuba tank or diving cylinder is another vital component of your diving gear. It stores large volumes of air, allowing you to breathe underwater. Most tanks have a maximum pressure rating of around 2000 to 3500 psi. Generally made of steel or aluminum, scuba tanks come in various styles and sizes. You can either rent them or invest in one if you plan to dive frequently.

**Regulator**

The function of the regulator is to convert the high-pressure air in the cylinder into normal-pressure air and then let us breathe. The regulator has the greatest impact on safety in all equipment. It has something called a first stage, which connects to the tank or diving cylinder you wear on your back, and a second stage—the part of the regulator that you put in your mouth. It also has a backup second stage and gauges. When choosing a regulator, comfort and performance is what you need first.

**Diving Computer**

It is almost listed in the to-buy list. It is a diversified multifunctional diving instrument that can check the safety stop time, dive depth, times, too fast speed warning, NOFLY time, historical record, etc. If you connect it to some small equipment, you can also check the residual pressure. Renting a dive computer can cost you more money, so it’s often better to just purchase one.

**BCD**

BCD (buoyancy control device) also called buoyancy compensator. It has three main functions: 

1. allows you to float on the water to rest or swim 

2. allows you to adjust your buoyancy when underwater

3. used as a back frame, carrying the entire scuba system on your body.

It’s basically a vest or jacket that you wear during your dive to help manage your buoyancy.

**Dive Light**

The diving flashlight can be used for night dive, cave dive and fill light in daily shooting. It also provides critical light when exploring cracks and crevices. Many dive lights have SOS mode, can be used to transmit signals. It is one of the necessary auxiliary tools for divers.

**Depth Gauge, Submersible Pressure Gauge &amp; Compass**

A depth gauge displays the current and maximum depth reached during a dive. A submersible pressure gauge (SPG) displays the amount of gas remaining in the scuba tank or diving cylinder, which makes you know how long you can stay underwater. Divers must develop the habit of constantly checking the SPG. A compass is used to identify the direction underwater. It is very important in diving, especially when there is low visibility.

Other things you may need for diving include diving gloves, diving boots, line wheel, surface Marker Buoy (SMB), diving headgear, pointer, diving camera, a diving knife and spare mouthpiece, etc.

My personal opinion is that anything mechanical will fail and if there is a back up air source we should also back up our regulators.  I understand (now) that this can be a bit of a hot topic amongst divers especially in the Public Safety world.  I’ve offered to buy my own Octo with my own funds and have been told that I cannot alter the main Rig.  That seems unreasonable to me.

I am itching for a diving trip. I always go abroad, would not even consider UK diving, too cold for me haha.

What are your current feelings towards booking trips in the near future?

- early/mid September
- Red Sea (Egypt) liveaboard
- the operators are all running and taking bookings.

Now I don’t need the best/photography worthy torch, bud I’d like to be seen even in low visibility conditions. 
I read about another option here : under water radiance scuba light. Anyone who has experience this one?

Do you have any experience/suggestions in this price range, or should I really wait a bit and go for a 300 € light?

I am here to ask about a mysterious creature known as ""the black carpet"". 
It seems to be a sort of urban legend among divers.
I was browsing 4chan in the /x/ thing, and found some info about ""the bloop"" sound. 
Some people started saying its actually a creature at least a mile long called ""the black carpet"" which is described as an animal composed of black feelers that walk on the ocean floor, eating up the nutrients.
More info here:

Mask and snorkel,
Fins,
Wetsuit (depending on your primary driving location and the temperatures),
Dive computers,
BCD,
Regulators and so on

Now in a post Covid world, does the order change, I mean don’t know who’s spat into the rental mask last, so mask is still going to be my No. 1 but shouldn’t a regulator now become the second most important thing?

Even though my sister and I nearly died as children drowning, I still love being under water. In pools I used to swim and sit underwater but now it hurts my ears and head to do that without anything to help. I still love being underwater. I can easily say that the only reason I go swimming is so that I can be underwater.  


Now I would love to take a course or class but unfortunately that type of class which requires gear (in my area) and to pay for the class as well is outside of my budget. I would barely be able to afford the gear. So I am looking to learn super gradually myself practicing everything in a pool or shallow river. I am here in Mid-Michigan so all we have are shallow rivers and some small lakes for swimming other than pools.  


I would love to know my options for diving. I know Scuba and Snorkeling but I am curious if there is anything else that could be done. Free diving is not a option for me. If I do do (hehe) snorkeling, is there a snorkel that I do not have to bite onto as I have not any teeth. If it is scuba diving what are some options for minimalist gear?

This last year I was working on my divemaster certification (I live in NYC so there is very limited opportunities to get the dives done) while going to college. Although all that got interrupted, I fully plan on finishing up my cert. 

Recently I have been really thinking about moving to florida (maybe Fort Lauderdale area) and working in a dive shop and eventually get my instructors cert. I just do not know where to start. However, I have so many questions that I do not even know how to begin researching. Will I be able to live on being a divemaster alone or will I need a second job? What are the benefits as a divemaster? How do I even begin looking at apartments? How much money should I save up before moving?

I do not plan on moving down for another year at least. I am gonna take a few years off college, maybe forever, and just work my ass off here and try and save up some money so I can afford everything until I get on my feet. It is never too early to research and look into things though.

I’m an adept diver (have been recreationally diving yearly during the summer months) but the only gear I use is a diving mask and fins (even that ocassionally).

I’m usually able to dive to the 7-8 meter mark at most (this is without fins) and that’s usually where I start to hit the incredible ear pain mark even though I desperately try to depressurise (blowing air through my ears/opening up my Eustachian tube - sorry not a native speaker).

Since that’s the depth I can reach without fins (and just about the depth I can hold my breath for), I’m pretty certain I’d be able to dive deeper with them but I usually have to stop and go back up due to the pain..

Is there any way to train myself or depressurise more effectively so I can reach deeper? I really wanna get to all the treasures I can see. :)

I am looking to make a bigger investment in my diving gear (Halcyon Eclypse 30 wings, ScubaPro Jet fins, a generic backplate+harness combo, and a bag to transport it all).

Since I travel to dive, I am looking for a bag that fits the following criteria:

* Can be checked in as luggage (I do not really care for cabin luggage for this application)
* Can be used to transport a full set of gear (my BPW, fins, mask, computer, knife; rented wetsuit, reg, weights, boots, compass, etc.) to the site, maybe with some odds and ends like a water bottle, phone, etc.
* *Ideally*, can take dunking/hosing my gear off and then draining the water - if I have a bag, it would be great if I could do this and leave it at the dive shop overnight for the next day.

So far, the Cressi Gorilla fits my bill - anyone here has any thoughts on that model? Alternatively, any other recommendations for me?",0.025,0.922,0.053,0.6592
0,50,1100,"To dive or not to dive? (corona virus precautions) Hi there. First post here. Complete diving baby (in every sense of the word). I PETER dived last July once (loved it); had my first class last Sunday (5.5 hours with lecture and pool); had my first panic attack reading about everything that can go wrong last night (anxiety mostly assuaged by a diver friend and my instructor since then). 

Kinda surprised I haven’t found any posts on corona virus and diving in Reddit. Assuming that’s because there’s not too many reasons to be concerned unless one shares their regulator with someone else?

I decided to cancel my class today and postpone until next week just to be sure. But my instructor assured me that she disinfects regulator with bleach and water. Plus I am her only student right now and the only one using that particular set of gear. 

Of course there’s also the question if one should leave their home during a shelter order (I live in SF bay) to do something as luxurious as scuba training. 

Just wondering what folks in here have to say about all this; I’m sure there will be differing opinions and maybe some controversy?

I just moved to Orlando, Florida from Colorado and am looking at hanging up the now useless skis to get into diving.

Please also refer me to an older post as I know I am not the only new guy asking questions (I haven’t found much). I am curious on the ideal way to go about buying gear and being certified on a tighter budget. Also, what brands should I get my equipment from and are there any to avoid? Also, any local spots to recommend for a beginner?

My plan with a tighter budget: 
- buy snorkel ($20), mask ($125), fins ($125) and 3mm wetsuit ($180) before I get certified
- get certified (~$500)
- go on a couple dives for about a year while saving up more money to buy a reg and bcd.

it was not due to ingesting saltwater, im thinking more motion-related. i cant look at my phone too long in a moving vehicle and i get nauseous with VR headsets on. so I am guessing this is something similar.

I have  got a bald head and got some minor sunburns during my last dives in  sunny regions. Therefore, I ordered several dive hoods for my next trip  to find a fitting one.

My problem  is: all size L hoods are too tight and feel uncomfortable. Even after a  couple of minutes it feels like I will get a headache.  
XL hoods feel  good and fit easily - maybe too easily? While the diving hood closes  well on my face and lies gently on my ears, it is very loose on my neck  and even leaves some space above my skullcap.

What are the disadvantages of slightly too loose hoods? Will air get trapped inside and make my head float?  
If it matters: The material for the hood I would like to keep is 90 % Neoprene and 10 % Nylon

So as of right now I have no idea how to prevent my ear drum from popping next time I dive, however I have looked at buying ear plugs and a swim cap to make sure no water gets in my ear as I go down. Is this a viable solution? What are your inputs/suggestions?

I  did my PADI AOW last week, did 7 dives within 3 days, went 30m down for  the deep dive and another time at 30m for the ship wrek. Never had  problem equalizing or never felt any pain under the water  during or  after the dives.

Then I took my  commercial flight back home 30h after my last dive. While I was in the  plane, I noticed that my ears were making internal crackling sound,  similar of when you squeeze a sponge. It does not affect my earing but  it is really annoying. It will append if I blow my nose, if I yawn, if I  chew gun, if I try to equalize at normal pressure, sometime when I  swallow and surprisingly when I took an elevator to the 10th floor of  the building I work at.

Is this  something I should be concern with (medical attention), how long till it  go away ? Was that caused by the ""last dive time"" before my commercial  flight ?

1. Is it smart doing the course already or would it be better doing a dive beforehand so I can see if I like diving? There are some companies offering great barrier reef dives without experience and a certification etc. but I do feel weird diving without proper training. I also never really went snorkeling in my life, so should I go snorkeling first and then see if I like it? (I got some mates snorkels to try them out in a lake and I already loved it)

2. I do am a little bit scared of sharks, but I dont think I will meet a great white shark while diving as a beginner or any other agressiv sharks ( I do want to dive with sharks once in my life)
But im kinda way more scared from the box and irukandji jellyfishes here in australia. Is there a high chance I can get stung by them while im in water?
Or am I stressing myself to much?

3. What are your guys tips to prevent panicking under water? 

4. Im also kinda scared that I fuck up and get decompression sickness. How high is the chance to fuck up? Or is it unlikely to happen if i follow the rules?

Im sorry if these questions sound dumb, but these are likely the only things that prevent me from learning how to dive.

hence currently considering it I should get another g7x mark1 (instead of mark 2 or mark 3 as they didnt fit in my existing case), or buy a gopro+case, or tg-6 + case. from what I read g7x mark 1 is still a better camera than tg-6. but tg-6 is waterproof to 15m, so in case I just jumped in and realise the case wasnt locked properly, then hurriedly lock it (like on my last dive), the camera is still safe. if I buy another g7x, just means I dont need to buy another camera case.",0.009,0.942,0.049,0.7611

My husband and I love snorkeling. I am a good swimmer so I feel very safe in the water for the most part. My husband on the other hand, sinks like a stone. Oddly enough we figured out he floats in the Pacific for some reason! However since he is decidedly NOT a swimmer, he needs a snorkel vest as a safety precaution. We already have the ""traditional"" vest, that almost like a life vest and you just blow it up in the front, and it is just got straps around the back and the crotch strap. He HATES the thing. He finds it rides up and chokes him, which is a no go. I have been looking for a vest that will not have this problem, however my barrel-chested babe has a 54"" inch chest..... I think you can see the problem.

I am in Thailand towards the end of Feb and early March next year and looking to leave the hotel for a few days on a liveaboard to dive The Similan Islands/Richelieu Rock. I was looking to book with [Liveaboard.com](https://Liveaboard.com) but reading their Trustpilot has made me extremely wary of using them to book. 

This will be my first time on a liveaboard and I will be travelling alone, so want to make sure I get the booking side of things right!

Does anyone have any experience with any of the tour operators in Khao Lak, or any experience booking from home before going? I am in the UK but open to using any agent!

I want to use it to dive in water of around 20 degrees Celsius but also in more tropical waters. The hood probably is not necessary but it might be more comfortable when doing multiple dives on a day. The drawback of a fixed hood for me is not having the possibility to leave it off for a dive in warmer water.

As per the title, I have always wanted to do a liveaboard (Komodo, Raja Ampat, Galapagos are all high up on my bucketlists), but I know I have a seasickness problem. I would classify it as moderate; I get nauseous aboard small boats (5-7m long) after 15 to 30 minutes and have thrown up due to seasickness before. Larger/faster boats tend to be okay. I have tried ginger pills, Stugeron but they do not usually do much to alleviate my symptoms.

Because of this, I have often limited myself to places where I know dive sites are close by (Gili T in Indonesia has been my major haunt) but I figured I would quite like to take the next step in my diving hobby.

I am rather apprehensive of spending a large sum of money of these liveaboards only to be seasick the entire time; but from what I gather, these boats are pretty large so I might just be okay. Fellow seasick divers, what are your experiences on a liveaboard? What did you guys do to prepare for your first liveaboard?

This coming early February my Partner and I would like to do our first liveaboard. I have been diving for a few years now (East Coast Australia (Not GBR), Mexico (West Coast), and the Andamans), I have Padi Advanced. My partner she is knew to diving and has recently completed her SSI Open Water. 

We've been tossing up a few ideas, which I think might be the problem (spoilt for choice). I am really after a nice experience (visibility, good weather, easy diving, friendly instructors) over a technical experience. 5 to 7 nights would be optimal (I think, happy to field advice though).

What we have thought about:

1. Similian Islands Thailand 

 \- Con: Many options (some are very expensive (diva andaman) (equivalent price to Maldives) 

 \- Con: Mixed Reviews (overcrowding, poor vis, itineraries not very thorough)

 \- Pro: Thailand is beautiful and relatively easy to get to from east coast AUS. Lots to do either side of liveaboard.

2. Phillipines 

 \- Pro/Con: Always wanted to go, but not sure what it is like. (stuff to do either side of liveaboard etc?)

 \- Pro: Seems well priced. Lots of options

 \- Bit harder to get too.

3. Maldives

 \- Pro: Partner Always wanted to go.

 \- Con: Not much to do either side of liveaboard.

 \- Pro: Visibility

 \- Mixed Reviews

 \- Con: Expensive 

 \- Expensive/hard to get too.

4. Raja Ampat

 \- Pro: Highly recommended

 \- Pro: Liveaboards are well priced, rave reviews. 

 \- Very hard and expensive get too. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am would be happy to hear any suggestions/tips/advice. Also what I have written above may or may not be correct, its just my general position from a few days deep diving through information. 

I am especially interested in what folks think is the best place for this time of year and places I should definitely rule out because of lack of experience or poor timing. 

We've also considered going locally for a liveaboard experience on the GBR, so open to suggestions there.

I live in Hawaii and after visiting multiple dive shops, I became very frustrated at the limited options available. I decided to go to a surf shop instead (I do not surf) and I found something that is way better for my specific needs than anything I have found online or in stores for diving.  


Additionally, I work in the tech industry and there are multiple unique solutions to problems that few have. I do not expect the dive industry to have this variety but I imagine there have to be companies trying to rethink what a dive experience should be (from wetsuits to BCDs, to computers).  


I struggled to formulate my question because I want this to be less about any specific type of diving and more about companies/gear that are trying to innovate and rethink what gear should look like and how it should feel.

Some of you may remember me from the summer, ""spamming"" this subreddit with surveys related to an [idea](https://www.reddit.com/r/diving/comments/c9rbtk/idea_global_dive_site_directory/) I had after almost not being able to complete my NAUI Master in Okinawa due to the rainy season kicking down the door and forcing several dive sites closed just as we were getting there.

So I floated the idea of a dive site directory where you can quickly pull weather reports (tide, currents, temperature), astronomical times (for planning night dives), and reports by local divers (waves, currents, temp, viz). Feedback was mixed, but I decided what the heck, and made the app. Now, I am gearing up for the beta and the first release, and I am looking to get as diverse a base as I can - all sorts of devices and use cases, see where the app performs best and worst.

If you would like to give the first version an early try, check out the [site](https://dso.provingground.tech/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=direct&amp;utm_campaign=bbeta-signup) \- the Android version should be entering its beta around the end of the week, with the iOS version maybe some time next week.

My accident was stupid, and doctors really did not help me that well - the first one gave me some bad advice that ended up being the reason why my tinnitus did not go away, the second one is nice but tries to scare me into never diving again. 

Right now it is hard to imagine what my relationship with the ocean will be like in the future, but considering how much my ENT doctor has scared me, I decided to at least start to try to get peace with the idea of only snorkeling in the future.

My girlfriend and I are going to the Maldives in 40 days and I plan to snorkel daily, but she is worried about snorkeling due to an experience she had 6 years ago when she got water in her ear and had 8 months of tinnitus / voice echoing with doctors unsure of the cause (no rupture or infection) and they just ended up recommending long term Sudafed or to try higher salt intake. She hasn’t put her head underwater or swam since then due to how bad it was for those 8 months. 

I’m trying to find a solution to get her comfortable with snorkeling, but am not trying to push too hard. She has never gone snorkeling before, but knows there’s obviously a risk of water getting into the ears. 

I found an ear mask by IST called the Pro Ear, but with her long hair and no pressure at surface to hold the seal tight, I’m not sure how effective this would be. I read that combining this with wax ear plugs would be more effective however. 

I am trying to get as close to 0% risk of water entering her ear as possible and am hoping this sub-reddit can help me show her that snorkeling is safe and incredible to witness in the Maldives (hope to see Whale shark, Manta Rays, Eagle Rays, and more). We would be doing light snorkeling, nothing with choppy waves and would descent from the boat slowly at sea to try and limit any jumping in causing water to rush into the ear. 

So, does anyone have any suggestions? I am sure there are many with long hair that must have had ear issues temporarily or permanently that found solutions to the same problem I am trying to solve.

I have made those a bit of a life habit and so being a stupid idea does not mean too much. i'd rather focus on the practicalities of whether it is possible or not. 

I have devoted my life to trying to create more community and human connection for the past 10 years, and have an event i want to publicise which would do a lot of good for everyone in the world.

It appears there is a window in the [Lobourg Channel](http://www.sussex.ac.uk/geography/researchprojects/coastview/Offshore/offshore.htm) creating a route where the maximum depth is between 30 and 40m, possibly a few meters deeper. 

I estimate it would take between 24 and 36hrs to complete if i can keep a decent speed, which is not far out of the range professional underwater welders sometimes do during heavy overtime. 

While researching i came across a [mad scotsman](https://divingalmanac.com/underwater-marathon/) who did an underwater marathon at up to 30m depth in Loch Ness. Although he did it in 4hr bursts over 12 days.

I would be intending to do it one sustained walk so i'd be down there a lot longer and around 10m deeper at some points. He was also using an old fashioned diving suit - with a kind sponsor i could probably have something far more mobile.

I guess a boat in shipping routes can be resolved as it is for those who swim the channel

The seabed seems to be mostly [course sand and pebbles](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Seabed-sediment-types-extracted-from-a-digital-version-of-the-sediment-map-of-the-English_fig7_278643613)

I was thinking a diving helmet and dry suit. attached to a boat on the surface pumping oxygen down, with a spare tank along with me with enough air to surface if oxygen was cut off from the boat.

** Potentially Insurmountable Issues **

- I have been unable to really gauge how much the current would effect someone walking along the bottom at that depth, especially crossing the Loubough Channel, as there are deep pools i could be swept into.
- There are large sand banks to walk up, which might simply not be possible underwater.
- The cliffs of the Loubough Channel. I am not sure how steep these are and if they would require actual climbing, which is probably a bit dangerous with a tube above you going up to the surface.

I would need to find sponsors for the kit and boat. Any other factors you can see which would make this impossible, or should be accounted for.",0.039,0.915,0.046,-0.0823
0,29,915,"[sea]water + eyes = who cares Ok, it is an odd title. I was snorkelling yesterday. Well, I tried but found the loop that holds the snorkel to the goggles was missing. Tried attaching it to the strap somehow but still somehow manage to lose the snorkel, and found it did not swim. Tried to search for it, but never liked pressure in the goggles on my eyes when going too deep. So I left them on a rock in the end and finally found the snorkel about 5m down in some seaweed. 

Long story, but why do people say that salt water stings in the eyes? I never had that issue. Does it really sting and my eyes are odd, or do people just expect it to sting? I am currently in the very warm eastern Mediterranean, which is more salty than most oceans but also do not have problems in the shallows on the Persian Gulf, which is even saltier. I only have problems with pools that contain way too much chloride. I can evidently also see quite well under water :)",0.071,0.81,0.119,0.8199

Had 4 dives yesterday aboard a liveaboard with an experienced guide, had a mild headache 20 mins into my 4th dive.  I took Tylenol after I came up and it went away quick. All dives were within 15-25 metres max. My instructor said it was because my breath was too shallow.

I have had a really bad headache before a few months ago during my AOW lessons on my 3rd dive to 30 metres, so I thought it was normal.  That one was due to dehydration.

This time, I hydrated throughout the day, took electrolytes, counted my breaths etc. But this is the 1st dive of the day, when I was down at 28ish metres diving a wreck, I felt my throat tighten and get very dry.  I was unable to swallow and felt like I was choking up in general. This was about 10 minutes in. I let the instructor know and I felt this way for the entire 30 mins dive. Then I threw up into the regulator during our safety stop despite not eating anything that morning.

What could have happened? I must admit I was a little panicky because of the whole dry mouth and being unable to swallow thing. Seems like I keep getting these issues when I am diving and it worries me, would love to know how to prevent it, any advice appreciated!",0.073,0.841,0.086,-0.2165

Santa Teresa definitely had the wildlife, from schools of small fish and moray eels through to lots of white tip reef sharks, a school of rays and some Baracuda. We even had a Humpback whale drop in on one of the dives!

Bocas on the other hand, below 10 meters, looked dead by comparison. There were a few interesting fish away from the wrecks, but not much. 
To Bocas credit however, the diving conditions were great, with no currents, warm water, decent visibility and a flat-calm surface. I would highly reccomend it to someone wanting to learn to dive.",0.05,0.807,0.143,0.902

The dive works by jumping off the wharf, going down 1 metre, filling up the mask and purging, removing the mask and putting it back on, then removing the respirator and buddy breathing. 

I got down to 1 metre, but as went down i struggled to be able to breathe without swallowing a lot of water. Then when i let water into the mask to purge it, it started feeling like i couldnt breathe at all. I was told i didnt have a tight enough seal around the respirator, and that I was subconciously breathing through my nose when water came into the mask. I ended up failing the suitability, and have another shot in 2 weeks.

Ive bought a snorkel and fins to practise being comfortable and confident breathing underwater and purging the mask. Planning on going to the pool or beach everyday after work to practise.

First let me start off by saying that I’m brand new to scuba diving. I just started my open water certification and am doing my ocean dive this coming weekend. I’m afraid that I can’t find a mask that fits and I don’t want to go down 55ft with a poorly fitting mask.

1. TUSA Tina Mask M1002
2. TUSA Freedom HD Mask
3. Oceanic Cyanea 2 Window Mask

Unfortunately I had the same problem with all three masks in that I can’t breathe through my nose in any of them. Either it’s too tight and I can’t inhale at all or there’s a little bit of water and I end up just snorting it and coughing it out my regulator.

Every spot I dove in Aruba had tons of healthy hard coral, good visibility and lots of species of fish and invertebrates. I only dove in two places in Aruba (it was a family vacation and I only had half a day for diving) but the conditions were drastically different. The visibility was not terrible but not great (maybe 30ft), the reefs were patchy and mostly soft corals, and the number of fish and invertebrate species was much less than in Bonaire. It reminded my of diving in Florida north of the Keys.   


I know that Bonaire is an especially well preserved reef for the Caribbean, but I was wondering whether I just went to wrong spots in Aruba (Star Garren and Pedernalis). Are there spur-and-groove or fringe reefs in Aruba that I missed? My in-laws love Aruba, so it is likely that we will be going back next year and I would like to pick better spots for diving.

0,46,1164,"[Survey] Dive Site Database - continued survey Hello again,

My name is Zalan, and I am currently developing a potential idea for a crowd-sourced dive site catalog application with user-provided condition info in addition to institutional weather and tide information.

The trigger for this was my recent certification trip in Okinawa, where the rainy season is entry almost made it impossible to get the last two required dives in due to a closed site and bad conditions.

In a recent survey I conducted among the diving community, a strong majority emerged for using such a service, but there was much less consensus on pricing. I want to address this point with a second, more focused survey that deals with the sustainability of such an application/service.

If you would like to contribute a second time, you can do so at the following link: [https://forms.gle/r4yMjuXDLwtYurvY9](https://forms.gle/r4yMjuXDLwtYurvY9)

I would be honored with every response, as each bit of data will help me make a decision on whether or not this idea should be pursued.

On the other hand, a snorkel could always come in handy, and it is already small, saving space in my luggage.

10th of August Ina Trælnes and Jani Santala will be going for a new Guinness World Record: The world is biggest water locked wedding (dive access only). This will obviously be  great day in diving history. The record attempt will be made in Plura air chamber, which is about 30 minutes from my hometown (Mo i Rana, Norway) and the number of diving guests will be more than 50.

The dive will be live streamed out on big screens for those who are not diving. 

In addition the minister doing the ceremony, Ben Reymenants, previously attended the GWR «Worlds deepest wedding». He was also attending the Thai Cave rescue last year, getting the boys out from the cave, So there is a lot of cool stuff going on

I was really nervous about it but did a lot of research and found a great diving center (Divewise in Malta) who took my friend and I out in a pair. I stuck close to the instructor and he gave me a lot of support and made me feel very safe. 

The first dive was more terrifying than enjoyable but I did have moments of 'wow this is incredible'. But after the first dive, I realised I would actually done quite a good job controlling my position and a lot of my nervousness went away. I asked for feedback after a every dive and he gave me really detailed tips and by the end of the second dive I started to actually feel quite confident. We did two more dives the next day and I felt really good by the end of the trip! 

Went diving again last weekend somewhere else and I had no nervousness at all. When they asked for my licence I felt like I would ernt it this time! Those dives were incredible too.

Hello,

I would like to share with you a less than satisfactory experience I have had with the PADI dive center X. CC'ing the school for transparency.

Over the last few months, I started diving and completed my PADI OpenWater and PADI Advanced certifications at X. Having nothing to compare the school to, I was fairly happy until recently, when I started my wreck diving specialty at the same dive center. We went on two dives to the Jasmin wreck, near X. I did not enjoy the dives very much and did not feel as if I had learned anything, as they consisted of simply swimming around the wreck and finding my way back to the anchor line.This week, partially because I was unhappy with my last two dives, and also because X had no space available on their boat, I decided to continue my wreck specialty at another dive center. X provided me with a referral form that (falsely) claims that I have completed the knowledge review and the skills of the first two wreck dives, even though I never did a knowledge review and did not do any skills aside from some basic navigation around the wreck. Despite that, the second dive center also informed me that I need to buy a ""wreck diving manual"", which is a book that X was supposed to give me. When I asked them if I can come by and pick the book up, they said that they do not have it and cannot buy it before Sunday, because today is still a public holiday in X.At that point, having realized that multiple PADI requirements were violated, and that they had essentially charged me for a book they never gave me, I asked for a refund, which they refused to provide. To summarize:

* **X failed to provide me with the wreck diving manual** as part of my wreck diving course. Had I finished the course there, they also would not have provided me with a manual since the shops would only reopen after I got my certification.
* **X did not teach any theory at all** for the wreck diving course and I never completed a knowledge review, even though the instructor claimed that I did in a referral form. In fact, the instructor did not brief me at all about wreck diving or that specific wreck, and it was very difficult for me to figure out what he expected me to do once underwater.
* **X did not teach the skills specified by PADI for the first two wreck dives**, even though the instructor signed my logbook and referral forms.
* When I presented the above points to them, the instructor got very defensive and said that I am not a dive-master or instructor, so I cannot question his compliance with PADI standards. He tried to argue that we did complete all the skills of the two wreck dives, and showed me a PDF listing the skills taught in the dives.To give an example:The PDF said something along the lines of: ""\*the student must map the wreck (\****or*** *parts of it)*"". My instructor tried to make the argument that we do not actually have to map the wreck because it says ""***or***"". This made me think that he either thinks I cannot read English and I am a complete fool, or that he actually does not understand this simple sentence.
* The instructor then said that he will give me my refund ""tomorrow"" (which I really doubt), and that I should give him my logbook so that he can delete his signature, which of course I refused to do because logbooks are meant to be append-only. 

Overall, this process made me feel as if I am being taken advantage of, by paying to let me swim around a wreck a little bit and then getting a piece of paper for my money. I was very disappointed, as I really wanted to learn wreck diving and I hope that this is not representative of X and diving schools in general.",0.129,0.824,0.047,-0.9965

It may look like I am a bit lost in PADI is slew of courses and lack of details in regard to which courses' content overlaps with another is... which is exactly what is happening, so thank you in advance for your patience !

&amp;#x200B;

^(I know no amount of PADI specialisation / vanity titles will make me a better diver, I just kinda need to get that AOW paper and get some practice afterwards to be able to dive some sites I have had my eyes onto for a while, and I like to know what I am getting into beforehand.)

&amp;#x200B;

1. Can we summarize that AOW is basically 5 Speciality courses bundled together, with two of them being mandatory, or am I missing something ?
2. The standalone ""Deep Diver"" speciality course says it ""enables"" you to go as deep as 40m but the AOW documentation says 30m, even though the deep diver ""speciality"" is supposed to be included, what gives ? ^(I want to say it is no a goal of mine to go as deep as possible as a newbie, I just like to know what I will learn and be paying for.)
3. Are there specialization that are known to not be feasible or not recommended to be bundled in an AOW course ? For example, most of the online information I came across says a Night Diver speciality takes 2 to 3 days, surely the training will be less thorough if taken as part of the AOW course right ?
4. Follow-up on point 3 : I was thinking on top of Deep and Navigation to take Buoyancy ^((i feel my trim could be better)) and Nitrox, then I want to start doing ""confined space"" dives and I do not know if Wreck or Cavern is better, I feel they are very similar and mostly depends on the availability of one or the other in the area you are at ?

PADI AOW-certified diver gets roped into being an instructor for a group of newbies and fails to notice a forming panic attack.

# Long version

I am a PADI AOW diver, doing my NAUI Master course in June-July. This week, I went off with my company to Krapanj, Croatia, where we went diving. There were three certified divers (one former instructor and divemaster) and five complete newbies in the group, with the certified divers taking one dive first, before the newbies were suited up and given a (very short, based on their account) briefing on the ship.

Afterwards, while the discovery divers were suiting up, the divemaster asked the three of us if we want to go another round, and I said yes, while the two others, including the instructor passed, so I got a new cylinder and the suddenly, I was told to pick a person, take them in the water, and take them around. In a completely unfamiliar area, I might add.

The person I chose, a close friend of mine, had trouble equalizing, so we had to ascend often, and at one point, she failed to inflate her BCD, and was bobbing in the water gasping for air with the regulator out of her mouth. I held her above the water, trying to calm her down, but did not think to inflate her BC either until I heard my ex-instructor colleague shout (for what he said was the seventh time) to do it.

It ended fine, my friend enjoyed the dive even despite this incident, but I was left with mixed feelings.

&amp;#x200B;

What do you guys think, who is at fault for this? Should I have noticed the forming panic attack before it came to head? Should the divemaster have allowed me to act as an instructor in the first place, not being certified as one?",0.073,0.869,0.059,-0.7476

0,97,1980,"Perforated ear drum as a result of scuba diving buddy panicking in the lake. (TLDR at the bottom) A short while ago, I was scuba diving in a murky lake (about 12m deep). The visibility was 3-5ft at the bottom and the only wildlife around were pikes and little insect larvae.

We were doing a navigation task at a team and my buddy refused to navigate due to not being comfortable with it. I was happy to do it. My task was to use the compass to navigate a short distance across the lake, then come back. His only task was to keep an eye on our buoyancy.

As you know, you are not supposed to hold on to each other. But he held on to my tank. On the way out there, we ended up surfacing due to him adding air to sort out his buoyancy but not checking our levels. So we had to go back down. No biggie. We descended and got ready to go again. We decided that this was enough distance and I went to alter the compass for the new direction.

My buddy then decided that he wanted to see the compass on my wrist too. Didn't tell me. No nudges l, pokes or signals. He let most of the air out of his BCD to come down to have a look. He let far too much out as he did a big single burst. He swam over my shoulder. As a result, he ended up squashing me as he was far too heavy (he was over 6ft, not a small build and I am 5'5ft). We sank rapidly towards the bottom of the lake.

I tried to get to the surface because I felt my ears screaming due to the quick pressure change. In his panic, he held on to me. We hit the bottom of the lake. Dropped about 4-5 meters in a few seconds. My ear went BANG. We did eventually get to the surface. I am currently on strong antibiotics for my ear. 

TLDR: diving buddy squashes me during a navigation task in the lake and causes my ear to perforate.

Has anyone else had this experience? Or one with buddy gone wrong? 

I am due to fly in 2 weeks (9 1/2 hour flight) for a family holiday and I was told having a perforated ear actually causes less discomfort on a plane. I also have my first diving holiday in just over a month. I hope my ear heals soon.",0.068,0.871,0.061,-0.6395

0,114,3162,"My first dive after getting an open water certification was a bit of a shitshow. I need some perspective, I guess. I did my open water course in January, in a place with cold-ish water (around 18C), lots of wildlife and good visibility. 

I decided to try diving again this week, in my Mediterranean travel destination. I didn’t feel confident to go straight to diving, so I had a refresher in the morning before going diving in the afternoon.

We had me, another diver more experienced but still pretty much a beginner, two dive masters and one almost dive master (late stages of training). 


It was quite a pretty wall dive that started shallow, we went to 17m and then slowly worked our way up. We didn’t need to have a stop at 5 because we would spend most of the later part of the dive between 7 and 4 meters, ascending slowly. 

I was doing great for most of it, keeping my buoyancy ok and not breathing too much out of anxiety. The other beginner diver who was my buddy almost never looked at me to check me out, and had buoyancy problems all the time, and required help from the 3 others frequently. 

Anyway, we are almost wrapping up, the dive, we are at 4 m deep and I already see the boat, when suddenly I see myself squeezed in a weird position close to the wall and my buoyancy goes haywire... I can’t stop myself from floating up, I do everything in the book to stop it but when I see I’m at the surface. Awesome :/. 

We are close to the boat, and I assumed maybe we could just finish the dive there... but my new dive buddy (who is now the dive master in training, we switched in the middle of the dive) insists that I have to return underwater to follow the rest of the group. 

So she helps me down a bit too fast, I can’t equalize... suddenly about 3 meters down my left ear “pops” and I instantly start feeling dizzy. I have fainted before, and that is exactly how it feels. I try to warn my buddy that I’m not feeling well, point to my ear, and say I need to go up. She says no, I repeat that I really need to, and just start swimming up. I barely make it out of the water, and I don’t even know who inflated my vest for me. I come back to it, and have a panic attack. I mean, feeling that I was fainting while under water was probably the scariest feeling I’ve ever felt. Never had a panic attack before, so great now I know how that feels too. 

So I spent the rest of the day (that was yesterday) feeling like shit with a lot of pain in my ear and a yellow/red fluid leaking out of it. Today I went to the doctor, who confirmed I punctured my eardrum, and gave me antibiotics. I am flying home tomorrow and will see my doctor there. 

What happened to my ear is not such a big deal, it will heal and soon I’ll be swimming and diving again. I’m just feeling like shit, because I feel like my inability to do things right ruined the dive for everybody else, and I feel like I put the people who were with me in danger. I love diving, but if I am so bad at this to the point of screwing up what was supposed to be an easy dive so bad, maybe there is no future for me there. I also feel so embarrassed, I never had a panic attack before and I just feel like a freaking drama queen. I don’t know, I need some perspective. Maybe this is really not for me :(",0.145,0.733,0.122,-0.9776

I am trying to figure out my diving plans related to certifications, and am not sure about a few things. I know that SSI and PADI certifications are recognized everywhere for both parties, to a certain level. Currently I have my SSI Open Water &amp; Advanced and have plans to do my Divemaster (and in a further future instructor) at SSI.

I am leaving for a next diving trip to the Philippines (Palawan area, tips appreciated!) soon, and realized I can almost solely find PADI schools there, at least online. I would be very grateful if someone could clarify the following for me:

&amp;#x200B;

1. If I would now get PADI certifications in for example Nitrox &amp; Deep dive, would this affect my path to SSI dive instructor in any way? 
2. In my scenario, if I would have to choose between PADI Nitrox&amp;DD vs a SSI Nitrox&amp;DD where the PADI one is cheaper, is there any reason it would still be logical to choose for SSI for my future diving plans?

&amp;#x200B;

I have since read that divers are supposed to exhale fully and take deep full breaths. You use less air and offload more carbon dioxide that way. If this is correct then how do divers also use their breath to control their buoyancy?  I feel like I am missing something really fundamental.

0,71,1282,"Why do not snorkels employ two one-way valves to avoid re-breathing CO2? Snorkels with purge valves at the bottom, below the mouthpiece, are very common.

Snorkels with ""float"" valves at the top are also very common, to prevent water from entering when diving down.  AKA dry snorkels.

But I have never seen a snorkel with an additional one-way valve inside that forces your exhalation out the bottom instead of out the top.

There are ""two tube"" snorkels around that do this:

https://www.powerbreather.com/en/

And full-face masks seem to do it as well (either with two tubes at the top, or forcing your exhalations out the bottom).

But that is all really complicated, compared to two one-way valves around the mouthpiece itself, one directing inhalations through the tube, and the other directing exhalations out through the bottom.  Or, for simplicity of design, the other one-way valve could be at the top of the snorkel, only letting air in up there, instead of out (there would be more ""mixing"" of the dead air during exhalation, but not too much).

The only down-side to exhalations going out the bottom seems to be bubbles and noise... it would make snorkeling less peaceful.  But scuba divers deal with bubbles from the regulator, an it is not so bad (they flow up the sides of the face, and not in front of the mask).

&amp;#x200B;

Any recommendations in either city? I have never dived so it will be the most basic intro possible

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks

0,57,1577,"short shallow freedives yesterday, now bloody nose/phlegm Yesterday I was doing some volunteer work for a local organization restoring reefs. I was freediving at like 8ft. Easy peazy right?  


Well, I was using a spare mask I had in a closet (not my usual dive mask which I currently have in a locker off site), it kind of hurt/ put pressure at the top of my nose (where it meets between the eyes). Just after helping out I went home and blew my nose and it was bloody. I cleared my sinuses after a few blows and it was ok for the rest of the evening. But I woke up this morning and I had bloody phlegm. I took it to mean that the bloody mucus just trickled downward over night. It is now noon and I still have spotty red chunky phlegm and mucus. I will admit that I was shooting up to the service fast yesterday. I am not used to freediving and my lungs need practice. I am out of air in like 12 seconds underwater doing the light work I was doing so I would come up fast b/c I was out of breath.  


Assuming this is sinus squeeze. This has never happened to me before scuba diving. I have no issues equalizing on long dives when on compressed air. I was supposed to go out (scuba) diving this morning but I am going to wait several more days before doing so.  


Any advice on how I can help speed up the healing process? The area at the top of my nose feels sore when I touch it. Maybe it is just a burst capillary from an ill-fitting mask and gravity is bringing it down the back of my throat? IDK, I feel fine otherwise but I will avoid submerging my face in pool or salt water to avoid infection.

After renting a pro rig in the Great barrier reef, I want to get into a bit of underwater video. I live in Hawaii so there are unlimited opportunities to get cool footage even from shore dives or snorkeling. 

Going to start out with a rig for my go pro, and work my way up to maybe one day getting a housing for my a7rii, or rx100. 

Been looking around this weekend, and there seems to be a surprising lack of info on putting together a casual rig. So far I am leaning towards the lume cube setup, it looks like a really versatile setup that I could also use for land photography. But I have not found many reviews on how it performs while doing deeper dives.

Are there any other lights I should look at as a go to, in that same $150ish price range?

Also is the supersuit the best housing for go pro? I am a bit apprehensive with removing the lens every time I go to switch it back.

Any links to what your photography rig consists of would be awesome. ",0.052,0.832,0.117,0.9521

I will start by saying that I have never dived or snorkeled at all, before but have a very keep interest. 
I have recently had a nasty bout of depression so have finally though 'Screw this I am going to do something I have always wanted to do!'
I have started to look up and research different things and figured I would come pop my head in and look around - I have heard wonderful things about the Diving communities that are around. 

I have set myself a longterm goal of diving in Australia, Ideally with Sharks - this has been a 'bucket list' thing for me for as long as I can remember and the sheer thought of actually doing it has really turned my mood around. 

I am not going to lie - I am not a powerful swimmer, I can swim but it has been a long time and my fitness has slipped a lot since then. So my first port of call is to get back to the gym and start hitting the pool. 

While I am doing that I have come here to adk your opinions on Diving lessons/being PADI registered. I live in the UK, and have a Go Dive! Close which offers PADI courses. Is this something I should pursue once I feel physically up to it, or should I look at other lessons first?

One main draw is the community - I really like the sound of the Social Diving groups- so if anyone is in/around Derby then I would love to chat about this stuff, maybe make a new friend? 

Thanks for your time, amd sorry if this is not the typical vein of content here!

TL:DR - New to Diving  
Want to, ultimately, dive with Sharks in AUS.

I got my PADI OW certification 3 weeks ago in the Perhentian Islands (plug Angel Divers) and just completed my AOW in Cebu (plug Cebu Dive Centre). I love diving and getting to see everything under the sea and was able to complete my certifications, but I cannot seem to get over the anxiety I have before going underwater and while under the water. It is okay because I can still dive and enjoy it, but it SEVERELY impacts my air consumption. The past few dives I would have to share air with a buddy during the safety stop and most of my fellow divers were coming up with 100 PSI or so. I know it is because I cannot control my breathing because my instructor said for every one breath he took I would take about three. I would have coffee and sometime take prescribed medication (ADHD) before dives and am wondering if anyone else has experience with stimulant medications and how that affects their air consumption. I am fairly confident that my medication gives me some anxiety and that it is exacerbated when under the water. I constantly feel that my air consumption will deplete and I will die or something else bad will happen and I will die, ironically causing me to consume more air and breathe faster. It is not so much the skills that cause me to breathe rapidly as it is the whole concept of being underwater and not being able to breathe through my nose/having to focus on breathing and worrying about forgetting to breathe or not being able to breathe. I have tried to control my breaths with limited success, I can breathe deeply for a bit but end up feeling like I am not getting enough air and end up taking a large amount of rapid breaths to feel better.

Just wondering if anyone else has experienced this diver is anxiety and what they did to help combat it and relax underwater. I have heard yoga and meditation, but wondering if maybe I just need to pop some anti-anxiety meds or maybe lay off the stimulants &amp; coffee. Thanks!",0.097,0.781,0.123,0.8603

I understand that the dead zone is minimised by having a skirt around the mouth and nose in a commercial mask, and that there is a block to push your nose against to equalize in a helmet, but that is about all I have found.

&amp;#x200B;

So, if you have any pictures of the inside of full-faced Scuba or Commercial masks that you can send to me so I can have a look and understand them that would be super-helpful!

&amp;#x200B;

With that in mind, I am also wondering about a little project to turn a full-face scuba mask into a useable free-diving mask by applying the same things that you would find in a commercial/full-faced mask. I assume it is simply a matter of it being a niche that is not profitable, or else they would be on the market? Or is the engineering side of it quite a challenge...",0.071,0.869,0.06,-0.7792

After a half year of hard work, a few days ago I launched my sustainable ocean-, scuba- and snorkeling brand Divehack.

I did that with an awesome kick off video and a kickstarter-campaign.

Divehack helps to protect the ocean and it’s aquatic life for future generations.

All Divehacks products are made with ocean preservation in mind, like an ocean cleanup bag, reef-safe sunscreen (which doesn’t harm the coral like most suncreams) and more.

I would love to hear your opinion and reviews :-) And feel free to join us and make this happen!

&amp;#x200B;

Two questions regarding that:

1. Does anyone have experience with this? Do most dive shops allow combing your own gear with their equipment?
2. If I buy my own regulator (Aqualung Legend LX DIN) with a console and inflatorhose, can I assume it will be compatible with most/all diving shop equipment over there?

Im looking for some advice, and thought this great community is the place to ask.

I did my padi OWD back in 2013 and logged just a handful of dives. Unfortunately, I havent dived in the last years and most of the knowledge is gone.
As Im going to the Red Sea in April (Marsa Alam), I would like to pick diving up again and proceed with the AOD.

Question: Would you recommend that I jump right into the AOW training or freshen up my knowledge first? 
Also, am I right to assume you first complete the theoretical part of the AOW training independently and then you go for the practical five dives, right?

Thank you for helping out :)

I have not yet found a compatible case that could withstand greater depths - does anyone know of such? I am kinda skittish about taking the standard case to 40 in the first place, since I am not sure I want to jeopardize my camera...

Looking back it was a dive far beyond my experience but I was young, and most importantly lucky (the guide was training an apprentice and both had double back mounts, I was 15 and between them with a single 80cf, all bad practice, dove with the guide 3x a day for a week before and he offered the dive to me, wasnt going to say no)

Started diving about 15 years ago, didnt take advantage of opportunities I had during those years but have about 200 dives, finally getting my master cert, then starting the sidemount course to move to tech, then tectrimix, cavern... ect. Still a long way out from where I want to be, but working with what I have until I have the opportunity to go further.

Naturally sidemount is a discipline to have, the instructor I have been working with normally dives sidemount but I would like to get a jump on the course before I start. He didnt have a extra harness for the course (also not available to rent where I am that I found) and modifying my travel BCD gave me a bad vibe, so wanting to work into tech then cavern I decided on the razor system. Looked at the Hollis 100, stealth, razor, OMS and nomad. Not entirely sure I made the right choice but I got it second hand for about half off. I set the harness up after watching a ton of YouTube videos (and the manual... I started with that, the webbing is still stupid stiff). However, the harness doesnt feel right where my D rings are and the idea of using bungees is strange to me, so.. any advice would be appreciated.

As for why I only have my travel rig, packing was an issue because I travel for long work stints and diving is an rare bonus, it is an oceanic jetpack (listen, drunk me isnt allowed on Amazon anymore... but it is pretty awesome as a carry on, that is about all I have to say for it)",0.074,0.802,0.125,0.9682

0,45,1259,"Nervous to try diving because of painful ears Hi there, 

I would like some opinions. I have wanted to dive since childhood, but now I have the financial means for it, I am nervous.

I like swimming, and took a life guard course half a year ago. I was never able to get to dive up the doll at the bottom of the pool at 3,75 meters (if I remember correctly), due to pain in my ears. (I got tips to clear my ears, but did not manage to do it). I tried to ignore the pain once, and got a painful ear infection the day after.
Now when I swim, I feel pressure at my ears already at a shallow level of 1-2 m or so. It seems worse than before, but maybe it is because I pay more attention to it?
My regular doctor says my ears are fine and says it is okay to start diving.
As a kid I once had an ear perforation because of swimming to the bottom of the pool. I do not remember anything of the event itself, so I do not think I felt the pressure in my ears as I do now. Or I just ignored it back then.

So now I want to start diving, but I am nervous that my ears will not handle it well. I do not see myself having much fun with this hobby if I were to deal with painful ears all the time. Is this something that will get better with training, or should I consider these  isigns' to try some other hobby instead ?

Basically, this past weekend my boyfriend and I went scuba diving at a center in a remote part of coastal Africa (I do not want to name names, but if you know, you know). In late 2018, a client who at this center ""disappeared"" during a shallow, day dive, and they only found her body a week later when it washed up on a beach 30 km away.

The reason for how she could disappear in good conditions (good vis, mild current) was never actually made public, so everyone kind of figured she had a heart attack or purposely swam away and just got lost and panicked, something like that. 

Anyway - this weekend I visited the center for the first time to do two dives. It was the strangest diving I have ever done. First the center itself was very dingy - the tractor to push the boat to the beach broke down, they gave me three empty cylinders before finding a full one - and they gave no briefing whatsoever for the first dive.  Oh, and they did not ask to see either mine or my boyfriend is certification ever.

But then a few minutes we got to the bottom of the dive site, we realized a client and the dive master were gone.

They had swam in the opposite direction of us, and it took about 15 minutes for us to find them again. We continued the dive after they were found, only for the dive master to go off on his own again.

The second dive I did with them was the first time I ever panicked underwater.

I reached 50 bar about 50 minutes into the dive, so I notified the dive master. He gave the OK sign, then continued to swim. I waited a few minutes, thinking maybe he was looking for something, but no, he was just continuing to look for fish. So I turned to another person who works at the center and notified her that I had 40 bar. She gave the OK. Nothing happened. We keep swimming. I start to panic a bit because now I am at 30 bar and the dive master nor anyone else seems to have any interest in surfacing (we were at 21m). Finally, at 20 fucking bar, I shake the dive master, point up, and start going up on my own. Finally he follows. 

I am still a fairly new diver so maybe I am overreacting. But for a dive center that had a client die under strange circumstances, these people seem to have very, very little interest in following a strict regiment. I would be interested to hear other divers' opinions. Maybe this happens other places more often than I think, so I would be interested to know.

I’m travelling fairly cheap, though technically I do have a decent budget, just don’t need to spend it all. I’ve already found flights for $350 for myself, so that’s cheap as dirt. I’ll be traveling with my diving partner, we plan to land in Can Cun and bus/ferry it to Cozumel. I’m wondering if you guys can suggest:

•Any particularly awesome dive shops I could rent and get tours from.
•Any great, not to expensive, Hotels
•Places to visit/sightsee 
•Any dive locations that were memorable. Wrecks, cave, crack, wall.

And especially any great stories you may have! Always up for a good tale. Thanks everybody!",0.017,0.838,0.145,0.9598

Having done with OW 10 years ago and refreshing and upgrading recently in Kuramathi, Maldives to SSI’s Nitrox and Deep Diving specialities, I’m in a position where I can’t afford to head back this year. I’m looking for a reasonably priced vacation idea (Wife plans on doing her DSD and maybe OW or equivalent) - budget of around £3,500 for 2 people, looking for a vacation as well as diving, so live-aboard not really an option.

We’d considered somewhere SE Asia, Thailand, Malaysia etc? Where would people suggest? If possible I’d like to be in with a chance of seeing whale sharks.

Thanks in advance

I can get about 2 months off work, and want to spend my time diving, learning about sharks and other wonderful creatures.
